Riot Act, April 29, 1992, by Ai| Poet| I'm going out and get something.| I don't know what.| I don't care.| Whatever's out there, I'm going to get it.| Look in those shop windows at boxes| and boxes of Reeboks and Nikes| to make me fly through the air| like Michael Jordan| like Magic.| While I'm up there, I see Spike Lee.| Looks like he's flying too| straight through the glass| that separates me| from the virtual reality| I watch everyday on TV.| I know the difference between| what it is and what it isn't.| Just because I can't touch it| doesn't mean it isn't real.| All I have to do is smash the screen,| reach in and take what I want.| Break out of prison.| South Central homey's newly risen| from the night of living dead,| but this time he lives,| he gets to give the zombies| a taste of their own medicine.| Open wide and let me in,| or else I'll set your world on fire,| but you pretend that you don't hear.| You haven't heard the word is coming down| like the hammer of the gun| of this black son, locked out of this big house,| while massa looks out the window and sees only smoke.| Massa doesn't see anything else,| not because he can't,| but because he won't.| He'd rather hear me talking about mo' money,| mo' honeys and gold chains| and see me carrying my favorite things| from looted stores| than admit that underneath my Raider's cap,| the aftermath is staring back| unblinking through the camera's lens,| courtesy of CNN,| my arms loaded with boxes of shoes| that I will sell at the swap meet| to make a few cents on the declining dollar.| And if I destroy myself| and my neighborhood| ain't nobody's business, if I do,| but the police are knocking hard| at my door| and before I can open it,| they break it down| and drag me in the yard.| They take me in to be processed and charged,| to await trial,| while Americans forget| the day the wealth finally trickled down| to the rest of us.| 
Twenty-year Marriage, by Ai| Poet| You keep me waiting in a truck| with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,| while you piss against the south side of a tree.| Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight.| That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows| and the seat, one fake leather thigh,| pressed close to mine is cold.| I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,| but get inside me, start the engine;| you'll have the strength, the will to move.| I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half.| Come on, baby, lay me down on my back.| Pretend you don't owe me a thing| and maybe we'll roll out of here,| leaving the past stacked up behind us;| old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again.| 
To Dorothy, by Marvin Bell| Poet| You are not beautiful, exactly.| You are beautiful, inexactly.| You let a weed grow by the mulberry| And a mulberry grow by the house.| So close, in the personal quiet| Of a windy night, it brushes the wall| And sweeps away the day till we sleep.| | A child said it, and it seemed true:| "Things that are lost are all equal."| But it isn't true. If I lost you,| The air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.| Someone would pull the weed, my flower.| The quiet wouldn't be yours. If I lost you,| I'd have to ask the grass to let me sleep.| 
To an Adolescent Weeping Willow, by Marvin Bell| Poet| I don't know what you think you're doing,| sweeping the ground. You| do it so easily, backhanded, forehanded.| You hardly bend. Really, you sway.| | What can it mean| when a thing is so easy?| | I threw dirt on my father's floor.| Not dirt, but a chopped green| dirt which picked up dirt.| | I pushed the push broom.| I oiled the wooden floor of the store.| | He bent over and lifted the coal| into the coal stove. With the back of the shovel| he came down on the rat just topping the bin| and into the fire.| | What do you think? - Did he sway?| Did he kiss a rock for luck?| Did he soak up water| and climb into light and turn and turn?| | Did he weep and weep in the yard?| | Yes, I think he did. Yes,| now I think he did.| | So, Willow, you come sweep my floor.| I have no store.| I have a yard. A big yard.| | I have a song to weep.| I have a cry.| | You who rose up from the dirt,| because I put you there| and like to walk my head in under| your earliest feathery branches-| what can it mean| when a thing is so easy?| | It means you are a boy.| 
Dream Song 26: The glories of the world struck me, by John Berryman| Poet| The glories of the world struck me, made me aria, once.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| if be you cares to say.| -Henry. Henry became interested in women's bodies,| his loins were & were the    scene of stupendous achievement.| Stupor. Knees, dear. Pray.| | All the knobs & softnesses of, my God,| the ducking & trouble it swarm on Henry,| at one time.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| you seems excited-like.| -Fell Henry back into    the original crime: art, rime| | besides a sense of others, my God, my God,| and a jealousy for the honour (alive) of his country,| what can get more odd?| and discontent with the thriving gangs & pride.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| -I had a most marvellous    piece of luck. I died.| 
Dream Song 172: Your face broods, by John Berryman| Poet| Your face broods from my table, Suicide.| Your force came on like a torrent toward the end| of agony and wrath.| You were christened in the beginning Sylvia Plath| and changed that name for Mrs Hughes and bred| and went on round the bend| | till the oven seemed the proper place for you.| I brood upon your face, the geography of grief,| hooded, till I allow| again your resignation from us now| though the screams of orphaned children fix me anew.| Your torment here was brief,| | long falls your exit all repeatingly,| a poor exemplum, one more suicide,| to stack upon the others| till stricken Henry with his sisters & brothers| suddenly gone pauses to wonder why he| alone breasts the wronging tide.| 
The Fish, by Elizabeth Bishop| Poet| I caught a tremendous fish| and held him beside the boat| half out of water, with my hook| fast in a corner of his mouth.| He didn't fight.| He hadn't fought at all.| He hung a grunting weight,| battered and venerable| and homely. Here and there| his brown skin hung in strips| like ancient wallpaper,| and its pattern of darker brown| was like wallpaper:| shapes like full-blown roses| stained and lost through age.| He was speckled and barnacles,| fine rosettes of lime,| and infested| with tiny white sea-lice,| and underneath two or three| rags of green weed hung down.| While his gills were breathing in| the terrible oxygen| --the frightening gills,| fresh and crisp with blood,| that can cut so badly--| I thought of the coarse white flesh| packed in like feathers,| the big bones and the little bones,| the dramatic reds and blacks| of his shiny entrails,| and the pink swim-bladder| like a big peony.| I looked into his eyes| which were far larger than mine| but shallower, and yellowed,| the irises backed and packed| with tarnished tinfoil| seen through the lenses| of old scratched isinglass.| They shifted a little, but not| to return my stare.| --It was more like the tipping| of an object toward the light.| I admired his sullen face,| the mechanism of his jaw,| and then I saw| that from his lower lip| --if you could call it a lip| grim, wet, and weaponlike,| hung five old pieces of fish-line,| or four and a wire leader| with the swivel still attached,| with all their five big hooks| grown firmly in his mouth.| A green line, frayed at the end| where he broke it, two heavier lines,| and a fine black thread| still crimped from the strain and snap| when it broke and he got away.| Like medals with their ribbons| frayed and wavering,| a five-haired beard of wisdom| trailing from his aching jaw.| I stared and stared| and victory filled up| the little rented boat,| from the pool of bilge| where oil had spread a rainbow| around the rusted engine| to the bailer rusted orange,| the sun-cracked thwarts,| the oarlocks on their strings,| the gunnels--until everything| was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!| And I let the fish go.| 
Warning to the Reader, by Robert Bly| Poet| Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean. Standing inside, we see around us, coming in through the cracks between shrunken wall boards, bands or strips of sunlight. So in a poem about imprisonment, one sees a little light.| But how many birds have died trapped in these granaries. The bird, seeing freedom in the light, flutters up the walls and falls back again and again. The way out is where the rats enter and leave; but the rat's hole is low to the floor. Writers, be careful then by showing the sunlight on the walls not to promise the anxious and panicky blackbirds a way out!| I say to the reader, beware. Readers who love poems of light may sit hunched in the corner with nothing in their gizzards for four days, light failing, the eyes glazed. They may end as a mound of feathers and a skull on the open boardwood floor. | 
The Russian, by Robert Bly| Poet| The Russians had few doctors on the front line.| My father's job was this: after the battle| Was over, he'd walk among the men hit,| Sit down and ask: 'Would you like to die on your| Own in a few hours, or should I finish it?'| Most said, 'Don't leave me.' The two would have| A cigarette. He'd take out his small notebook-| We had no dogtags, you know- and write the man's| Name down, his wife's, his children, his address, and what| He wanted to say. When the the cigarette was done,| The soldier would turn his head to the side. My father| Finished off four hundred men that way during the war.| He never went crazy. They were his people.| | He came to Toronto. My father in the summers| Would stand on the lawn with a hose, watering| The grass that way. It took a long time. He'd talk| To the moon, to the wind. 'I can hear you growing'-| He'd say to the grass. 'We come and go.| We're no different from each other. We are all| Part of something. We have a home.' When I was thirteen,| I said, 'Dad, do you know they've invented sprinklers| Now?' He went on watering the grass.| 'This is my life. Just shut up if you don't understand it.'| 
A Lovely Love, by Gwendolyn Brooks| Poet| Let it be alleys. Let it be a hall| Whose janitor javelins epithet and thought| To cheapen hyacinth darkness that we sought| And played we found, rot, make the petals fall.| Let it be stairways, and splintery box| Where you have thrown me, scraped me with your kiss,| Have honed me, have released me after this| Cavern kindness, smiled away our shocks.| This is the birthright of our lovely love.| In swaddling clothes. Not like that Other one.| Nor lit by any fondling star above.| Nor found by any wise men, either. Run.| People are coming. They must not catch us here| Definitionless in this strict atmosphere.| 
The Choir, by Olga Broumas| Poet| I walk and I rest while the eyes of my dead| look through my own, inaudible| hosannas greet| the panorama charged serene| and almost ultraviolet with so much witness.| Holy the sea, the palpitating membrane| divided into dazzling fields and whaledark by the sun.| 
at the cemetery, walnut grove plantation, south carolina, 1989, by Lucille Clifton| Poet| among the rocks| at walnut grove| your silence drumming| in my bones,| tell me your names.| | nobody mentioned slaves| and yet the curious tools| shine with your fingerprints.| nobody mentioned slaves| but somebody did this work| who had no guide, no stone,| who moulders under rock.| | tell me your names,| tell me your bashful names| and i will testify.| | the inventory lists ten slaves| but only men were recognized.| | among the rocks| at walnut grove| some of these honored dead| were dark| some of these dark| were slaves| some of these slaves| were women| some of them did this| honored work.| tell me your names| foremothers, brothers,| tell me your dishonored names.| here lies| here lies| here lies| here lies| hear| 
scar, by Lucille Clifton| Poet| we will learn| to live together.| | i will call you| ribbon of hunger| and desire| empty pocket flap| edge of before and after.| | and you| what will you call me?| | woman i ride| and who cannot throw me| | and i will not fall off.| 
Japan, by Billy Collins| Poet| Today I pass the time reading| a favorite haiku,| saying the few words over and over.| | It feels like eating| the same small, perfect grape| again and again.| | I walk through the house reciting it| and leave its letters falling| through the air of every room.| | I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.| I say it in front of a painting of the sea.| I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.| | I listen to myself saying it,| then I say it without listening,| then I hear it without saying it.| | And when the dog looks up at me,| I kneel down on the floor| and whisper it into each of his long white ears.| | It's the one about the one-ton temple bell| with the moth sleeping on its surface,| | and every time I say it, I feel the excruciating| pressure of the moth| on the surface of the iron bell.| | When I say it at the window,| the bell is the world| and I am the moth resting there.| | When I say it at the mirror,| I am the heavy bell| and the moth is life with its papery wings.| | And later, when I say it to you in the dark,| you are the bell,| and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,| | and the moth has flown| from its line| and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed.| 
Writing in the Afterlife, by Billy Collins| Poet| I imagined the atmosphere would be clear,| shot with pristine light,| not this sulphurous haze,| the air ionized as before a thunderstorm.| | Many have pictured a river here,| but no one mentioned all the boats,| their benches crowded with naked passengers,| each bent over a writing tablet.| | I knew I would not always be a child| with a model train and a model tunnel,| and I knew I would not live forever,| jumping all day through the hoop of myself.| | I had heard about the journey to the other side| and the clink of the final coin| in the leather purse of the man holding the oar,| but how could anyone have guessed| | that as soon as we arrived| we would be asked to describe this place| and to include as much detail as possible-| not just the water, he insists,| | rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water,| not simply the shackles, but the rusty,| iron, ankle-shredding shackles-| and that our next assignment would be| | to jot down, off the tops of our heads,| our thoughts and feelings about being dead,| not really an assignment,| the man rotating the oar keeps telling us-| | think of it more as an exercise, he groans,| think of writing as a process,| a never-ending, infernal process,| and now the boats have become jammed together,| | bow against stern, stern locked to bow,| and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.| 
The Language, by Robert Creeley| Poet| Locate I| love you some-| where in| | teeth and| eyes, bite| it but| | take care not| to hurt, you| want so| | much so| little. Words| say everything.| | I| love you| again,| | then what| is emptiness| for. To| | fill, fill.| I heard words| and words full| | of holes| aching. Speech| is a mouth.| 
The Warning, by Robert Creeley| Poet| For love - I would| split open your head and put| a candle in| behind the eyes.| | Love is dead in us| if we forget| the virtues of an amulet| and quick surprise.| 
Adultery, by James Dickey| Poet| We have all been in rooms| We cannot die in, and they are odd places, and sad.| Often Indians are standing eagle-armed on hills| | In the sunrise open wide to the Great Spirit| Or gliding in canoes or cattle are browsing on the walls| Far away gazing down with the eyes of our children| | Not far away or there are men driving| The last railspike, which has turned| Gold in their hands. Gigantic forepleasure lives| | Among such scenes, and we are alone with it| At last. There is always some weeping| Between us and someone is always checking| | A wrist watch by the bed to see how much| Longer we have left. Nothing can come| Of this nothing can come| | Of us: of me with my grim techniques| Or you who have sealed your womb| With a ring of convulsive rubber:| | Although we come together,| Nothing will come of us. But we would not give| It up, for death is beaten| | By praying Indians by distant cows historical| Hammers by hazardous meetings that bridge| A continent. One could never die here| | Never die never die| While crying. My lover, my dear one| I will see you next week| | When I'm in town. I will call you| If I can. Please get hold of Please don't| Oh God, Please don't any more I can't bear.  Listen:| | We have done it again we are| Still living. Sit up and smile,| God bless you. Guilt is magical.| 
Tomatoes, by Stephen Dobyns| Poet| A woman travels to Brazil for plastic| surgery and a face-lift. She is sixty| and has the usual desire to stay pretty.| Once she is healed, she takes her new face| out on the streets of Rio. A young man| with a gun wants her money. Bang, she's dead.| The body is shipped back to New York,| but in the morgue there is a mix-up. The son| is sent for. He is told that his mother| is one of these ten different women.| Each has been shot. Such is modern life.| He studies them all but can't find her.| With her new face, she has become a stranger.| Maybe it's this one, maybe it's that one.| He looks at their breasts. Which ones nursed him?| He presses their hands to his cheek.| Which ones consoled him? He even tries| climbing onto their laps to see which| feels most familiar but the coroner stops him.| Well, says the coroner, which is your mother?| They all are, says the young man, let me| take them as a package. The coroner hesitates,| then agrees. Actually, it solved a lot of problems.| The young man has the ten women shipped home,| then cremates them all together. You've seen| how some people have a little urn on the mantel?| This man has a huge silver garbage can.| In the spring, he drags the garbage can| out to the garden and begins working the teeth,| the ash, the bits of bone into the soil.| Then he plants tomatoes. His mother loved tomatoes.| They grow straight from seed, so fast and big| that the young man is amazed. He takes the first| ten into the kitchen. In their roundness,| he sees his mother's breasts. In their smoothness| he finds the consoling touch of her hands.| Mother, mother, he cries, and flings himself| on the tomatoes. Forget about the knife, the fork,| the pinch of salt. Try to imagine the filial| starvation, think of his ravenous kisses.| 
Fragments, by Stephen Dobyns| Poet| Now there is a slit in the blue fabric of air.| His house spins faster. He holds down books,| chairs; his life and its objects fly upward:| vanishing black specks in the indifferent sky.| | The sky is a torn piece of blue paper.| He tries to repair it, but the memory| of death is like paste on his fingers| and certain days stick like dead flies.| | Say the sky goes back to being the sky| and the sun continues as always. Now,| knowing what you know, how can you not see| thin cracks in the fragile blue vaults of air.| | My friend, what can I give you or darkness| lift from you but fragments of language,| fragments of blue sky. You had three| beautiful daughters and one has died.| 
Wingfoot Lake, by Rita Dove| Poet| (Independence Day, 1964)| On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her| her first swimming pool. It had been| his favorite color, exactly-just| so much of it, the swimmers' white arms jutting| into the chevrons of high society.| She had rolled up her window| and told him to drive on, fast.| | Now this act of mercy: four daughters| dragging her to their husbands' company picnic,| white families on one side and them| on the other, unpacking the same| squeeze bottles of Heinz, the same| waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip bags.| So he was dead for the first time| on Fourth of July-ten years ago| | had been harder, waiting for something to happen,| and ten years before that, the girls| like young horses eyeing the track.| Last August she stood alone for hours| in front of the T.V. set| as a crow's wing moved slowly through| the white streets of government.| That brave swimming| | scared her, like Joanna saying| Mother, we're Afro-Americans now!| What did she know about Africa?| Were there lakes like this one| with a rowboat pushed under the pier?| Or Thomas' Great Mississippi| with its sullen silks? (There was| the Nile but the Nile belonged| | to God.) Where she came from| was the past, 12 miles into town| where nobody had locked their back door,| and Goodyear hadn't begun to dream of a park| under the company symbol, a white foot| sprouting two small wings.| 
The Stairway, by Stephen Dunn| Poet| The architect wanted to build a stairway| and suspend it with silver, almost invisible| guy wires in a high-ceilinged room,| a stairway you couldn't ascend or descend except in your dreams. But first -| because wild things are not easily seen| if what's around them is wild -| he'd make sure the house that housed it| was practical, built two-by-four by| two-by-four, slat by slat, without ornament.| The stairway would be an invitation| to anyone who felt invited by it,| and depending on your reaction he'd know| if friendship were possible.| The house he'd claim as his, but the stairway| would be designed to be ownerless,| tilted against any suggestion of a theology,| disappointing to those looking for politics.| Of course the architect knew| that over the years he'd have to build| other things the way others desired,| knew that to live in this world was to trade| a few industrious hours for one beautiful one.| Yet every night when he got home| he could imagine, as he walked in the door,| his stairway going nowhere, not for sale,| and maybe some you to whom nothing| about it need be explained, waiting,| the wine decanted, the night about to unfold.| 
The Strange People, by Louise Erdrich| Poet| The antelope are strange people .  they are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. We do not trust them. They appear and disappear; they are like shadows on the plains. Because of their great beauty, young men sometimes follow the antelope and are lost forever. Even if those foolish ones find themselves and return, they are never again right in their heads.| -Pretty Shield,| Medicine Woman of the Crows| transcribed and edited by| Frank Linderman (1932)| All night I am the doe, breathing| his name in a frozen field,| the small mist of the word| drifting always before me.| | And again he has heard it| and I have gone burning| to meet him, the jacklight| fills my eyes with blue fire;| the heart in my chest| explodes like a hot stone.| | Then slung like a sack| in the back of his pickup,| I wipe the death scum| from my mouth, sit up laughing| and shriek in my speeding grave.| | Safely shut in the garage,| when he sharpens his knife| and thinks to have me, like that,| I come toward him,| a lean gray witch| through the bullets that enter and dissolve.| | I sit in his house| drinking coffee till dawn| and leave as frost reddens on hubcaps,| crawling back into my shadowy body.| All day, asleep in clean grasses,| I dream of the one who could really wound me.| Not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a look.| Not even with his goodness.| | If a man was never to lie to me. Never lie me.| I swear I would never leave him.| 
New Vows, by Louise Erdrich| Poet| The night was clean as the bone of a rabbit blown hollow.| I cast my hood of dogskin| away, and my shirt of nettles.| Ten years had been enough. I left my darkened house.| | The trick was in living that death to its source.| When it happened, I wandered toward more than I was.| | Widowed by men, I married the dark firs,| As if I were walking in sleep toward their arms.| I drank, without fear or desire,| this odd fire.| | Now shadows move freely within me as words.| These are eternal, these stunned, loosened verbs.| And I can't tell you yet| how truly I belong| | to the hiss and shift of wind,| these slow, variable mouths| through which, at certain times, I speak in tongues.| 
Sexual Jealousy, by Carol Frost| Poet| Think of the queen mole who is unequivocal,| exuding a scent to keep the other females neuter| and bringing forth the colonly's only babies, hairless and pink in the| dark| of her tunneled chamber. She may chew a pale something, a root,| find it tasteless, drop it for the dreary others to take away, then| demand| more; she must suckle the young. Of course| they all hate her and are jealous of the attention given her| by her six bedmates. In their mutual dream she is dead and her urine| no longer arrests their maturing. As irises infallibly unfold,| one of their own will feel her sex grow quickest and greatest. As they| dig| together, their snouts full of soil, they hope this and are ruthless in| their waiting.| 
The Undressing, by Carol Frost| Poet| They took off their clothes 1000 nights| and felt the plaster of the moon| sift over them, and the ground roll| them in its dream. Little did they know| the light light and clay and their own sweat| became a skin they couldn't wash away.| Each night bonded to the next,| and they grew stiffer. They noticed this| in sunlight - there were calluses,| round tough moons on their extremities,| shadows under their eyes,| and sometimes a faint sour smell they hadn't had as children.| It worried them, but at night the animal| in their bodies overcame their reluctance| to be naked with each other,| and the mineral moon did its work.| At last when they woke up and were dead,| statues on their backs in the park,| they opened their mouths| and crawled out, pitifully soft and small,| not yet souls.| 
To Kill a Deer, by Carol Frost| Poet| Into the changes of autumn brush| the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears| were the tinsel browns. They made her.| I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples,| and I shot her. Into the pines she ran,| and I ran after. I might have lost her,| seeing no sign of blood or scuffle,| but felt myself part of the woods,| a woman with a doe's ears, and heard her| dying, counted her last breaths like a song| of dying, and found her dying.| I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets,| then poked her with the gun barrel| because her eyes were dusty and unreal.| I opened her belly and pushed the insides| like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole,| skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee,| took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell| that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes.| I left her refolded in some briars| with the last sun on her head| like a benediction, head tilted on its axis| of neck and barren bone; head bent| wordless over a death, though I heard| the night wind blowing through her fur,| heard riot in the emptied head.| 
Nostos, Louise Gluck| Poet| There was an apple tree in the yard --| this would have been| forty years ago -- behind,| only meadows. Drifts| of crocus in the damp grass.| I stood at that window:| late April. Spring| flowers in the neighbor's yard.| How many times, really, did the tree| flower on my birthday,| the exact day, not| before, not after? Substitution| of the immutable| for the shifting, the evolving.| Substitution of the image| for relentless earth. What| do I know of this place,| the role of the tree for decades| taken by a bonsai, voices| rising from the tennis courts --| Fields. Smell of the tall grass, new cut.| As one expects of a lyric poet.| We look at the world once, in childhood.| The rest is memory.| 
Celestial Music, by Louise Gluck| Poet| I have a friend who still believes in heaven.| Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God.| She thinks someone listens in heaven.| On earth she's unusually competent.| Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.| | We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it.| I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality| But timid also, quick to shut my eyes.| Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out| According to nature. For my sake she intervened| Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down| Across the road.| | My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains| My aversion to reality. She says I'm like the child who| Buries her head in the pillow| So as not to see, the child who tells herself| That light causes sadness-| My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me| To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-| | In my dreams, my friend reproaches me. We're walking| On the same road, except it's winter now;| She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music:| Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing.| Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees| Like brides leaping to a great height-| Then I'm afraid for her; I see her| Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-| | In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;| From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.| It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact| That we're at ease with death, with solitude.| My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move.| She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image| Capable of life apart from her.| We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition| Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air| Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering-| It's this stillness we both love.| The love of form is a love of endings.| 
How Simile Works, by Albert Goldbarth| Poet| The drizzle-slicked cobblestone alleys| of some city;| and the brickwork back| of the lumbering Galapagos tortoise| they'd set me astride, at the "petting zoo". .| | The taste of our squabble still in my mouth| the next day;| and the brackish puddles sectioning| the street one morning after a storm. .| | So poetry configures its comparisons.| | My wife and I have been arguing; now| I'm telling her a childhood reminiscence,| stroking her back, her naked back that was| the particles in the heart of a star and will be| again, and is hers, and is like nothing| else, and is like the components of everything.| 
The Older Child, by Kimiko Hahn| Poet| What will become of her earliest memory --| the sperm whale battling the giant squid| in the dark exhibition at the museum?| looking up at 3 am| to see her sister pressed against two white breasts?| or maybe her yellow room| filled with the noise of boys in the vacant lot:| bang, boom-boom, fuckyoufuckyoufuck you.| 
The Porcelain Couple, by Donald Hall| Poet| When Jane felt well enough for me to leave her| for a whole day, I drove south by the river| to empty my mother Lucy's house in Connecticut.| I hurried from room to room, cellar to attic,| opening a crammed closet, then turning| to discover a chest with five full drawers.| I labelled for shipping sofas and chairs,| bedroom sets, and tables; I wrapped figurines| and fancy teacups in paper, preserving things| she cherished--and dreaded, in her last years,| might go for a nickel on the Spring Glen lawn.| Everywhere I looked I saw shelves and tabletops| covered with Lucy's glass animals and music boxes.| Everywhere in closets, decades of dresses hung| in dead air. I carried garbage bags in one hand,| and with the other swept my mother's leftover| possessions into sacks for the Hamden dump.| I stuffed bags full of blouses, handkerchiefs,| and the green-gold dress she wore to Bermuda.| At the last moment I discovered and saved| a cut-glass tumbler, stained red at the top,| Lucy 1905 scripted on the stain. In the garage| I piled the clanking bags, then drove four hours| north with my hands tight on the Honda's wheel,| drank a beer looking through Saturday's mail,| pitched into bed beside Jane fitfully asleep,| and woke exhausted from rolling unendable| nightmares of traffic and fire. In my dreams| I grieved or mourned interchangeably for Lucy,| for Lucy's things, for Jane, and for me.| When I woke, I rose as if from a drunken sleep| after looting a city and burning its temples.| All day as I ate lunch or counted out pills,| or as we lay weeping, hugging in bed together,| I counted precious things from our twenty years:| a blue vase, a candelabrum Jane carried on her lap| from the Baja, and the small porcelain box| from France I found under the tree one Christmas| where a couple in relief stretch out asleep,| like a catafalque, on the pastel double bed| of the box's top, both wearing pretty nightcaps.| 
Reuben, Reuben, by Michael S. Harper| Poet| I reach from pain| to music great enough| to bring me back,| swollenhead, madness,| lovefruit, a pickle of hate| so sour my mouth twicked| up and would not sing;| there's nothing in the beat| to hold it in| melody and turn human skin;| a brown berry gone| to rot just two days on the branch;| we've lost a son,| the music, jazz, comes in.| 
Our Lady of the Snows, by Robert Hass| Poet| In white,| the unpainted statue of the young girl| on the side altar| made the quality of mercy seem scrupulous and calm.| | When my mother was in a hospital drying out,| or drinking at a pace that would put her there soon,| I would slip in the side door,| light an aromatic candle,| and bargain for us both.| Or else I'd stare into the day-moon of that face| and, if I concentrated, fly.| | Come down! come down!| she'd call, because I was so high.| | Though mostly when I think of myself| at that age, I am standing at my older brother's closet| studying the shirts,| convinced that I could be absolutely transformed| by something I could borrow.| And the days churned by,| navigable sorrow.| 
The Image, by Robert Hass| Poet| The child brought blue clay from the creek| and the woman made two figures: a lady and a deer.| At that season deer came down from the mountain| and fed quietly in the redwood canyons.| The woman and the child regarded the figure of the lady,| the crude roundnesses, the grace, the coloring like shadow.| They were not sure where she came from,| except the child's fetching and the woman's hands| and the lead-blue clay of the creek| where the deer sometimes showed themselves at sundown.| 
Those Winter Sundays, by Robert Hayden| Poet| Sundays too my father got up early| And put his clothes on in the blueback cold,| then with cracked hands that ached| from labor in the weekday weather made| banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.| | I'd wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.| When the rooms were warm, he'd call,| and slowly I would rise and dress,| fearing the chronic angers of that house,| | Speaking indifferently to him,| who had driven out the cold| and polished my good shoes as well.| What did I know, what did I know| of love's austere and lonely offices?| 
This Night, by William Heyen| Poet| Which is our star this night?| Belsen is bathed in blue,| every footworn lane, every| strand of wire, pale blue.| The guards' bodies,| the prisoners' bodies--all| black and invisible.  Only| their pale blue eyes| float above the lanes| or between the wires.| Or they are all dead,| and these are the blue eyes of those| haunted by what happened here.| Which eyes are yours,| which mine?  Even| blue-eyed crows| drift the darkness overhead.  Even| blue-eyed worms| sip dew from the weeping leaves| of the black Erika| over the graves. .| But now, at once, every| eye, every blue light| closes.  As we do.| For rest.  For now.| Which was our star this night?| 
Playing Dead, by Andrew Hudgins| Poet| Our father liked to play a game.| He played that he was dead.| He took his thick black glasses off| and stretched out on the bed.| | He wouldn't twitch and didn't snore| or move in any way.| He didn't even seem to breathe!| We asked, Are you okay?| | We tickled fingers up and down| his huge, pink, stinky feet-| He didn't move; he lay as still| as last year's parakeet.| | We pushed our fingers up his nose,| and wiggled them inside-| Next, we peeled his eyelids back.| Are you okay? we cried.| | I really thought he might be dead| and not just playing possum,| because his eyeballs didn't twitch| when I slid my tongue across 'em.| | He's dead, we sobbed-but to be sure,| I jabbed him in the jewels.| He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,| though I don't think Jesus drools.| | His right hand lashed both right and left.| His left hand clutched his scrotum.| And the words he yelled-I know damn well| I'm way too young to quote 'em.| 
Degrees Of Gray In Philipsburg, by Richard Hugo| Poet| You might come here Sunday on a whim.| Say your life broke down. The last good kiss| you had was years ago. You walk these streets| laid out by the insane, past hotels| that didn't last, bars that did, the tortured try| of local drivers to accelerate their lives.| Only churches are kept up. The jail| turned 70 this year. The only prisoner| is always in, not knowing what he's done.| | The principal supporting business now| is rage. Hatred of the various grays| the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,| The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls| who leave each year for Butte. One good| restaurant and bars can't wipe the boredom out.| The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,| a dance floor built on springs--| all memory resolves itself in gaze,| in panoramic green you know the cattle eat| or two stacks high above the town,| two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse| for fifty years that won't fall finally down.| | Isn't this your life? That ancient kiss| still burning out your eyes? Isn't this defeat| so accurate, the church bell simply seems| a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?| Don't empty houses ring? Are magnesium| and scorn sufficient to support a town,| not just Philipsburg, but towns| of towering blondes, good jazz and booze| the world will never let you have| until the town you came from dies inside?| | Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty| when the jail was built, still laughs| although his lips collapse. Someday soon,| he says, I'll go to sleep and not wake up.| You tell him no. You're talking to yourself.| The car that brought you here still runs.| The money you buy lunch with,| no matter where it's mined, is silver| and the girl who serves your food| is slender and her red hair lights the wall.| 
Absences, by Donald Justice| Poet| It's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers.| There is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote,| Like the memory of scales descending the white keys| Of a childhood piano--outside the window, palms!| And the heavy head of the cereus, inclining,| Soon to let down its white or yellow-white.| | Now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap,| Like the memory of a white dress cast down . . .| So much has fallen.| And I, who have listened for a step| All afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away,| Already in memory. And the terrible scales descending| On the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers abounding.| 
Variations On A Text By Vallejo, by Donald Justice| Poet| Me moriré en Paris con aguacero . | | I will die in Miami in the sun,| On a day when the sun is very bright,| A day like the days I remember, a day like other days,| A day that nobody knows or remembers yet,| And the sun will be bright then on the dark glasses of strangers| And in the eyes of a few friends from my childhood| And of the surviving cousins by the graveside,| While the diggers, standing apart, in the still shade of the palms,| Rest on their shovels, and smoke,| Speaking in Spanish softly, out of respect.| | | I think it will be on a Sunday like today,| Except that the sun will be out, the rain will have stopped,| And the wind that today made all the little shrubs kneel down;| And I think it will be a Sunday because today,| When I took out this paper and began to write,| Never before had anything looked so blank,| My life, these words, the paper, the gray Sunday;| And my dog, quivering under a table because of the storm,| Looked up at me, not understanding,| And my son read on without speaking, and my wife slept.| | | Donald Justice is dead. One Sunday the sun came out,| It shone on the bay, it shone on the white buildings,| The cars moved down the street slowly as always, so many,| Some with their headlights on in spite of the sun,| And after awhile the diggers with their shovels| Walked back to the graveside through the sunlight,| And one of them put his blade into the earth| To lift a few clods of dirt, the black marl of Miami,| And scattered the dirt, and spat,| Turning away abruptly, out of respect.| 
After Making Love we Hear Footsteps, by Galway Kinnell| Poet| For I can snore like a bullhorn| or play loud music| or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman| and Fergus will only sink deeper| into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash,| but let there be that heavy breathing| or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house| and he will wrench himself awake| and make for it on the run-as now, we lie together,| after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies,| familiar touch of the long-married,| and he appears-in his baseball pajamas, it happens,| the neck opening so small he has to screw them on-| and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep,| his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child.| | In the half darkness we look at each other| and smile| and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body-| this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making,| sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake,| this blessing love gives again into our arms.| 
Blackberry Eating, by Galway Kinnell| Poet| I love to go out in late September| among the fat, overripe, icy, black blackberries| to eat blackberries for breakfast,| the stalks very prickly, a penalty| they earn for knowing the black art| of blackberry-making; and as I stand among them| lifting the stalks to my mouth, the ripest berries| fall almost unbidden to my tongue,| as words sometimes do, certain peculiar words| like strengths or squinched,| many-lettered, one-syllabled lumps,| which I squeeze, squinch open, and splurge well| in the silent, startled, icy, black language| of blackberry -- eating in late September.| 
Thrall, by Carolyn Kizer| Poet| The room is sparsely furnished:| A chair, a table, and a father.| | He sits in the chair by the window.| There are books on the table.| The time is always just past lunch.| | You tiptoe past as he eats his apple| And reads. He looks up, angry.| He has heard your asthmatic breathing.| | He will read for years without looking up| Until your childhood is safely over:| | Smells, untidiness, and boring questions;| Blood from the first skinned knees| To the first stained thighs;| The foolish tears of adolescent love.| | One day he looks up, pleased| At the finished product,| Now he is ready to love you!| | So he coaxes you in the voice reserved| For reading Keats. You agree to everything.| | Drilled in silence and duty,| You will give him no cause for reproach.| He will boast of you to strangers.| | When the afternoon is older| Shadows in a small room| Fall on he bed, the books, the father.| | You read aloud to him| "La Belle Dame sans Merci."| You feed him his medicine.| You tell him you love him.| | You wait for his eyes to close at last| So you may write this poem.| 
The Intruder, by Carolyn Kizer| Poet| My mother-preferring the strange to the tame:| Dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung,| Frog's belly distended with finny young,| Leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool,| Odd, small snakes roving through the leaves,| Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all| Wild and natural!-flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she| Picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,| And held the little horror to the mirror, where| He gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off.| | Depended from her pinched thumb, each wing| Came clattering down like a small black shutter.| Still tranquil, she began, "It's rather sweet . "| The soft mouse body, the hard feral glint| In the caught eyes. Then we saw,| And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow,| Nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.| The thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud,| Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth| Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop.| | But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor| Remained, of all my mother's tender, wounding passion| For a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life| Among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,| Whose denizens can turn upon the world| With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,| To sting or soil benevolence, alien| As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.| She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the tap,| She washed and washed the pity from her hands.| 
Facing It, by Yusef Komunyakaa| Poet| My black face fades,| hiding inside the black granite.| I said I wouldn't,| dammit: No tears.| I'm stone. I'm flesh.| My clouded reflection eyes me| like a bird of prey, the profile of night| slanted against morning. I turn| this way--the stone lets me go.| I turn that way--I'm inside| the Vietnam Veterans Memorial| again, depending on the light| to make a difference.| I go down the 58,022 names,| half-expecting to find| my own in letters like smoke.| I touch the name Andrew Johnson;| I see the booby trap's white flash.| Names shimmer on a woman's blouse| but when she walks away| the names stay on the wall.| Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's| wings cutting across my stare.| The sky. A plane in the sky.| A white vet's image floats| closer to me, then his pale eyes| look through mine. I'm a window.| He's lost his right arm| inside the stone. In the black mirror| a woman's trying to erase names:| No, she's brushing a boy's hair.| 
Audacity of the Lower Gods, by Yusef Komunyakaa| Poet| I know salt marshes that move along like one big| trembling wing. I've noticed insects| shiny as gold in a blues singer's teeth| & more keenly calibrated than a railroad watch,| but at heart I'm another breed.| | The audacity of the lower gods-| whatever we name we own.| Diversiloba, we say, unfolding poison oak.| Lovers go untouched as we lean from bay windows| with telescopes trained on a yellow sky.| | I'd rather let the flowers| keep doing what they do best.| Unblessing each petal,| letting go a year's worth of white| death notes, busily unnaming themselves.| 
Heaven as Anus, by Maxine Kumin| Poet| In the Defense Department there is a shop| where scientists sew the eyelids of rabbits open| lest they blink in the scorch of a nuclear drop| | and elsewhere dolphins are being taught to defuse| bombs in the mock-up of a harbor and monkeys| learn to perform the simple tasks of draftees.| | It is done with electric shocks. Some mice| who have failed their time tests in the maze| now go to the wire unbidden for their jolts.| | Implanting electrodes yields rich results:| alley cats turn from predators into prey.| Show them a sparrow and they cower| | while the whitewall labs fill up with the feces of fear| where calves whose hearts have been done away| with walk and bleat on plastic pumps.| | And what is any of this to the godhead,| these squeals, whines, writhings, unexpected jumps,| whose children burn alive, booby-trap the dead,| lop ears and testicles, core and disembowel?| | It all ends at the hole. No words may enter| the house of excrement. We will meet there| as the sphincter of the good Lord opens wide| and He takes us all inside.| 
Nurture, by Maxine Kumin| Poet| From a documentary on marsupials I learn| that a pillowcase makes a fine| substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo.| | I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue.| They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims,| from an overabundance of maternal genes.| | Bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb,| lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn.| Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn.| | And had there been a wild child -| filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called| in one nineteenth-century account -| | a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,| given my fireside inked with paw prints,| there would have been room.| | Think of the language we two, same and not-same| might have constructed from sign,| scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel:| | Laughter our first noun, and our long verb. howl.| 
The Abduction, by Stanley Kunitz| Poet| Some things I do not profess| to understand, perhaps| not wanting to, including| whatever it was they did| with you or you with them| that timeless summer day| when you stumbled out of the wood,| distracted, with your white blouse torn| and a bloodstain on your skirt.| "Do you believe?" you asked.| Between us, through the years,| we pieced enough together| to make the story real:| how you encountered on the path| a pack of sleek, grey hounds,| trailed by a dumbshow retinue| in leather shrouds; and how| you were led, through leafy ways,| into the presence of a royal stag,| flaming in his chestnut coat,| who kneeled on a swale of moss| before you; and how you were borne| aloft in triumph through the green,| stretched on his rack of budding horn,| till suddenly you found yourself alone| in a trampled clearing.| | That was a long time ago,| almost another age, but even now,| when I hold you in my arms,| I wonder where you are.| Sometimes I wake to hear| the engines of the night thrumming| outside the east bay window| on the lawn spreading to the rose garden.| You lie beside me in elegant repose,| a hint of transport hovering on your lips,| indifferent to the harsh green flares| that swivel through the room,| searchlights controlled by unseen hands.| Out there is a childhood country,| bleached faces peering in| with coals for eyes.| Our lives are spinning out| from world to world;| the shapes of things| are shifting in the wind.| What do we know| beyond the rapture and the dread?| 
My Indigo, by Li-Young Lee| Poet| It's late. I've come| to find the flower which blossoms| like a saint dying upside down.| The rose won't do, nor the iris.| I've come to find the moody one, the shy one,| downcast, grave, and isolated.| Now, blackness gathers in the grass,| and I am on my hands and knees.| What is its name?| | Little sister, my indigo,| my secret, vaginal and sweet,| you unfurl yourself shamelessly| toward the ground. You burn. You live| a while in two worlds| at once.| 
Eating Alone, by Li-Young Lee| Poet| I've pulled the last of the year's young onions.| The garden is bare now. The ground is cold,| brown and old. What is left of the day flames| in the maples at the corner of my| eye. I turn, a cardinal vanishes.| By the cellar door, I wash the onions,| then drink from the icy metal spigot.| | Once, years back, I walked beside my father| among the windfall pears. I can't recall| our words. We may have strolled in silence. But| I still see him bend that way-left hand braced| on knee, creaky-to lift and hold to my| eye a rotten pear. In it, a hornet| spun crazily, glazed in slow, glistening juice.| | It was my father I saw this morning| waving to me from the trees. I almost| called to him, until I came close enough| to see the shovel, leaning where I had| left it, in the flickering, deep green shade.| | White rice steaming, almost done. Sweet green peas| fried in onions. Shrimp braised in sesame| oil and garlic. And my own loneliness.| What more could I, a young man, want.| 
The Mutes, by Denise Levertov| Poet| Those groans men use| passing a woman on the street| or on the steps of the subway| | to tell her she is a female| and their flesh knows it,| | are they a sort of tune,| an ugly enough song, sung| by a bird with a slit tongue| | but meant for music?| | Or are they the muffled roaring| of deafmutes trapped in a building that is| slowly filling with smoke?| | Perhaps both.| | Such men most often| look as if groan were all they could do,| yet a woman, in spite of herself,| | knows it's a tribute:| if she were lacking all grace| they'd pass her in silence:| | so it's not only to say she's| a warm hole. It's a word| | in grief-language, nothing to do with| primitive, not an ur-language;| language stricken, sickened, cast down| | in decrepitude. She wants to| throw the tribute away, dis-| gusted, and can't,| | it goes on buzzing in her ear,| it changes the pace of her walk,| the torn posters in echoing corridors| | spell it out, it| quakes and gnashes as the train comes in.| Her pulse sullenly| | had picked up speed,| but the cars slow down and| jar to a stop while her understanding| | keeps on translating:| 'Life after life after life goes by| | without poetry,| without seemliness,| without love.'| 
Wedding-Ring, by Denise Levertov| Poet| My wedding-ring lies in a basket| as if at the bottom of a well.| Nothing will come to fish it back up| and onto my finger again.| It lies| among keys to abandoned houses,| nails waiting to be needed and hammered| into some wall,| telephone numbers with no names attached,| idle paperclips.| It can't be given away| for fear of bringing ill-luck.| It can't be sold| for the marriage was good in its own| time, though that time is gone.| Could some artificer| beat into it bright stones, transform it| into a dazzling circlet no one could take| for solemn betrothal or to make promises| living will not let them keep? Change it| into a simple gift I could give in friendship?| 
They Feed They Lion, by Philip Levine| Poet| Out of burlap sacks, out of bearing butter,| Out of black bean and wet slate bread,| Out of the acids of rage, the candor of tar,| Out of creosote, gasoline, drive shafts, wooden dollies,| They Lion grow.| | Out of the gray hills| Of industrial barns, out of rain, out of bus ride,| West Virginia to Kiss My Ass, out of buried aunties,| Mothers hardening like pounded stumps, out of stumps,| Out of the bones' need to sharpen and the muscles' to stretch,| They Lion grow.| | Earth is eating trees, fence posts,| Gutted cars, earth is calling in her little ones,| "Come home, Come home!" From pig balls,| From the ferocity of pig driven to holiness,| From the furred ear and the full jowl come| The repose of the hung belly, from the purpose| They Lion grow.| | From the sweet glues of the trotters| Come the sweet kinks of the fist, from the full flower| Of the hams the thorax of caves,| From "Bow Down" come "Rise Up,"| Come they Lion from the reeds of shovels,| The grained arm that pulls the hands,| They Lion grow.| | From my five arms and all my hands,| From all my white sins forgiven, they feed,| From my car passing under the stars,| They Lion, from my children inherit,| From the oak turned to a wall, they Lion,| From they sack and they belly opened| And all that was hidden burning on the oil-stained earth| They feed they Lion and he comes.| 
Animals Are Passing From Our Lives, by Philip Levine| Poet| Listen| It's wonderful how I jog| on four honed-down ivory toes| my massive buttocks slipping| like oiled parts with each light step.| | I'm to market. I can smell| the sour, grooved block, I can smell| the blade that opens the hole| and the pudgy white fingers| | that shake out the intestines| like a hankie. In my dreams| the snouts drool on the marble,| suffering children, suffering flies,| | suffering the consumers| who won't meet their steady eyes| for fear they could see. The boy| who drives me along believes| | that any moment I'll fall| on my side and drum my toes| like a typewriter or squeal| and shit like a new housewife| | discovering television,| or that I'll turn like a beast| cleverly to hook his teeth| with my teeth. No. Not this pig.| 
"To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage", by Robert Lowell| Poet| "The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.| Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.| My hopped up husband drops his home disputes,| and hits the streets to cruise for prostitutes,| free-lancing out along the razor's edge.| This screwball might kill his wife, then take the pledge.| Oh the monotonous meanness of his lust. | It's the injustice. he is so unjust--| whiskey-blind, swaggering home at five.| My only thought is how to keep alive.| What makes him tick?Each night now I tie| ten dollars and his car key to my thigh. | Gored by the climacteric of his want,| he stalls above me like an elephant| 
Onions, by William Matthews| Poet| How easily happiness begins by| dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter| slithers and swirls across the floor| of the sauté pan, especially if its| errant path crosses a tiny slick| of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions.| | This could mean soup or risotto| or chutney (from the Sanskrit| chatni, to lick). Slowly the onions| go limp and then nacreous| and then what cookbooks call clear,| though if they were eyes you could see| | clearly the cataracts in them.| It's true it can make you weep| to peel them, to unfurl and to tease| from the taut ball first the brittle,| caramel-colored and decrepit| papery outside layer, the least| | recent the reticent onion| wrapped around its growing body,| for there's nothing to an onion| but skin, and it's true you can go on| weeping as you go on in, through| the moist middle skins, the sweetest| | and thickest, and you can go on| in to the core, to the bud-like,| acrid, fibrous skins densely| clustered there, stalky and in-| complete, and these are the most| pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare| | and rage and murmury animal| comfort that infant humans secrete.| This is the best domestic perfume.| You sit down to eat with a rumor| of onions still on your twice-washed| hands and lift to your mouth a hint| | of a story about loam and usual| endurance. It's there when you clean up| and rinse the wine glasses and make| a joke, and you leave the minutest| whiff of it on the light switch,| later, when you climb the stairs.| 
Charles on Fire, by James Merrill| Poet| Another evening we sprawled about discussing| Appearances. And it was the consensus| That while uncommon physical good looks| Continued to launch one, as before, in life| (Among its vaporous eddies and false claims),| Still, as one of us said into his beard,| "Without your intellectual and spiritual| Values, man, you are sunk." No one but squared| The shoulders of their own unlovliness.| Long-suffering Charles, having cooked and served the meal,| Now brought out little tumblers finely etched| He filled with amber liquor and then passed.| "Say," said the same young man, "in Paris, France,| They do it this way"--bounding to his feet| And touching a lit match to our host's full glass.| A blue flame, gentle, beautiful, came, went| Above the surface. In a hush that fell| We heard the vessel crack. The contents drained| As who should step down from a crystal coach.| Steward of spirits, Charles's glistening hand| All at once gloved itself in eeriness.| The moment passed. He made two quick sweeps and| Was flesh again. "It couldn't matter less,"| He said, but with a shocked, unconscious glance| Into the mirror. Finding nothing changed,| He filled a fresh glass and sank down among us.| 
b o d y, by James Merrill| Poet| Look closely at the letters. Can you see,| entering (stage right), then floating full,| then heading off-so soon-| how like a little kohl-rimmed moon| o plots her course from b to d| | -as y, unanswered, knocks at the stage door?| Looked at too long, words fail,| phase out. Ask, now that body shines| no longer, by what light you learn these lines| and what the b and d stood for.| 
For the Anniversary of My Death, by W.S. Merwin| Poet| Every year without knowing it I have passed the day| When the last fires will wave to me| And the silence will set out| Tireless traveller| Like the beam of a lightless star| Then I will no longer| Find myself in life as in a strange garment| Surprised at the earth| And the love of one woman| And the shamelessness of men| As today writing after three days of rain| Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease| And bowing not knowing to what| 
When You Go Away, by W.S. Merwin| Poet| When you go away the wind clicks around to the north| The painters work all day but at sundown the paint falls| Showing the black walls| The clock goes back to striking the same hour| That has no place in the years| | And at night wrapped in the bed of ashes| In one breath I wake| It is the time when the beards of the dead get their growth| I remember that I am falling| That I am the reason| And that my words are the garment of what I shall never be| Like the tucked sleeve of a one-armed boy| 
Minor Miracle, by Marilyn Nelson| Poet| Which reminds me of another knock-on-wood| memory. I was cycling with a male friend,| through a small midwestern town. We came to a 4-way| stop and stopped, chatting. As we started again,| a rusty old pick-up truck, ignoring the stop sign,| hurricaned past scant inches from our front wheels.| My partner called, "Hey, that was a 4-way stop!"| The truck driver, stringy blond hair a long fringe| under his brand-name beer cap, looked back and yelled,| "You fucking niggers!"| And sped off.| My friend and I looked at each other and shook our heads.| We remounted our bikes and headed out of town.| We were pedaling through a clear blue afternoon| between two fields of almost-ripened wheat| bordered by cornflowers and Queen Anne's lace| when we heard an unmuffled motor, a honk-honking.| We stopped, closed ranks, made fists.| It was the same truck. It pulled over.| A tall, very much in shape young white guy slid out:| greasy jeans, homemade finger tattoos, probably| a Marine Corps boot-camp footlockerful| of martial arts techniques.| | "What did you say back there!" he shouted.| My friend said, "I said it was a 4-way stop.| You went through it."| "And what did I say?" the white guy asked.| "You said: 'You fucking niggers.'"| The afternoon froze.| | "Well," said the white guy,| shoving his hands into his pockets| and pushing dirt around with the pointed toe of his boot,| "I just want to say I'm sorry."| He climbed back into his truck| and drove away.| 
The Small Vases from Hebron, by Naomi Shihab Nye| Poet| Tip their mouths open to the sky.| Turquoise, amber,| the deep green with fluted handle,| pitcher the size of two thumbs,| tiny lip and graceful waist.| | Here we place the smallest flower| which could have lived invisibly| in loose soil beside the road,| sprig of succulent rosemary,| bowing mint.| | They grow deeper in the center of the table.| | Here we entrust the small life,| thread, fragment, breath.| And it bends. It waits all day.| As the bread cools and the children| open their gray copybooks| to shape the letter that looks like| a chimney rising out of a house.| | And what do the headlines say?| | Nothing of the smaller petal| perfectly arranged inside the larger petal| or the way tinted glass filters light.| Men and boys, praying when they died,| fall out of their skins.| The whole alphabet of living,| heads and tails of words,| sentences, the way they said,| "Ya'Allah!" when astonished,| or "ya'ani" for "I mean"-| a crushed glass under the feet| still shines.| But the child of Hebron sleeps| with the thud of her brothers falling| and the long sorrow of the color red.| 
Hello, by Naomi Shihab Nye| Poet| Some nights| the rat with pointed teeth| makes his long way back| to the bowl of peaches.| He stands on the dining room table| sinking his tooth| drinking the pulp| of each fruity turned-up face| knowing you will read| this message and scream.| It is his only text,| to take and take in darkness,| to be gone before you awaken| and your giant feet| start creaking the floor.| | Where is the mother of the rat?| The father, the shredded nest,| which breath were we taking| when the rat was born,| when he lifted his shivering snout| to rafter and rivet and stone?| I gave him the names of the devil,| seared and screeching names,| I would not enter those rooms| without a stick to guide me,| I leaned on the light, shuddering,| and the moist earth under the house,| the trailing tails of clouds,| said he was in the closet,| the drawer of candles,| his nose was a wick.| | How would we live together| with our sad shoes and hideouts,| our lock on the door| and his delicate fingered paws| that could clutch and grip,| his blank slate of fur| and the pillow where we press our faces?| The bed that was a boat is sinking.| And the shores of morning loom up| lined with little shadows,| things we never wanted to be, or meet,| and all the rats are waving hello.| 
Personal Poem, by Frank O'Hara| Poet| Now when I walk around at lunchtime| I have only two charms in my pocket| an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me| and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case| when I was in Madrid the others never| brought me too much luck though they did| help keep me in New York against coercion| but now I'm happy for a time and interested| | I walk through the luminous humidity| passing the House of Seagram with its wet| and its loungers and the construction to| the left that closed the sidewalk if| I ever get to be a construction worker| I'd like to have a silver hat please| and get to Moriarty's where I wait for| LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and| shaker the last five years my batting average| is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in| and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12| times last night outside BIRDLAND by a cop| a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible| disease but we don't give her one we| don't like terrible diseases, then| we go eat some fish and some ale it's| cool but crowded we don't like Lionel Trilling| we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like| Henry James so much we like Herman Melville| we don't want to be in the poets' walk in| San Francisco even we just want to be rich| and walk on girders in our silver hats| I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is| thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi| and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go| back to work happy at the thought possibly so| 
Why I Am Not A Painter, by Frank O'Hara| Poet| I am not a painter, I am a poet.| Why? I think I would rather be| a painter, but I am not. Well,| | for instance, Mike Goldberg| is starting a painting. I drop in.| "Sit down and have a drink" he| says. I drink; we drink. I look| up. "You have SARDINES in it."| "Yes, it needed something there."| "Oh." I go and the days go by| and I drop in again. The painting| is going on, and I go, and the days| go by. I drop in. The painting is| finished. "Where's SARDINES?"| All that's left is just| letters, "It was too much," Mike says.| | But me? One day I am thinking of| a color: orange. I write a line| about orange. Pretty soon it is a| whole page of words, not lines.| Then another page. There should be| so much more, not of orange, of| words, of how terrible orange is| and life. Days go by. It is even in| prose, I am a real poet. My poem| is finished and I haven't mentioned| orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call| it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery| I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.| 
May 1968, by Sharon Olds| Poet| When the Dean said we could not cross campus| until the students gave up the buildings,| we lay down, in the street,| we said the cops will enter this gate| over us. Lying back on the cobbles,| I saw the buildings of New York City| from dirt level, they soared up| and stopped, chopped off--above them, the sky,| the night air over the island.| The mounted police moved, near us,| while we sang, and then I began to count,| 12, 13, 14, 15,| I counted again, 15, 16, one| month since the day on that deserted beach,| 17, 18, my mouth fell open,| my hair on the street,| if my period did not come tonight| I was pregnant. I could see the sole of a cop's| shoe, the gelding's belly, its genitals--| if they took me to Women's Detention and did| the exam on me, the speculum,| the fingers--I gazed into the horse's tail| like a comet-train. All week, I had| thought about getting arrested, half-longed| to give myself away. On the tar--| one brain in my head, another,| in the making, near the base of my tail--| I looked at the steel arc of the horse's| shoe, the curve of its belly, the cop's| nightstick, the buildings streaming up| away from the earth. I knew I should get up| and leave, but I lay there looking at the space| above us, until it turned deep blue and then| ashy, colorless, Give me this one| night, I thought, and I'll give this child| the rest of my life, the horse's heads,| this time, drooping, dipping, until| they slept in a circle around my body and my daughter| 
University Hospital, Boston, by Mary Oliver| Poet| The trees on the hospital lawn| are lush and thriving. They too| are getting the best of care,| like you, and the anonymous many,| in the clean rooms high above this city,| where day and night the doctors keep| arriving, where intricate machines| chart with cool devotion| the murmur of the blood,| the slow patching-up of bone,| the despair of the mind.| | When I come to visit and we walk out| into the light of a summer day,| we sit under the trees -| buckeyes, a sycamore, and one| black walnut brooding| high over a hedge of lilacs| as old as the red-brick building| behind them, the original| hospital built before the Civil War.| We sit on the lawn together, holding hands| while you tell me: you are better.| | How many young men, I wonder,| came here, wheeled on cots off the slow trains| from the red and hideous battlefields| to lie all summer in the small and stuffy chambers| while doctors did what they could, longing| for tools still unimagined, medicines still unfound,| wisdoms still unguessed at, and how many died| staring at the leaves of the trees, blind| to the terrible effort around them to keep them alive?| I look into your eyes| | which are sometimes green and sometimes gray,| and sometimes full of humor, but often not,| and tell myself, you are better,| because my life without you would be| a place of parched and broken trees.| Later walking the corridors down to the street,| I turn and step inside an empty rom.| Yesterday someone was here with a gasping face.| Now the bed is made all new,| the machines have been rolled away. The silence| continues, deep and neutral,| as I stand there, loving you.| 
The Summer Day, by Mary Oliver| Poet| Who made the world?| Who made the swan, and the black bear?| Who made the grasshopper?| This grasshopper, I mean--| the one who has flung herself out of the grass,| the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,| who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down--| who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.| Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.| Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.| I don't know exactly what a prayer is.| I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down| into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,| how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,| which is what I have been doing all day.| Tell me, what else should I have done?| Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?| Tell me, what is is you plan to do| With your one wild and precious life?| 
Dearest Reader, by Michael Palmer| Poet| He painted the mountain over and over again| from his place in the cave, agape| at the light, its absence, the mantled| skull with blue-tinted hollows, wren-| like bird plucking berries from the fire| her hair alight and so on| lemon grass in cafe in clear glass.| Dearest reader there were trees| formed of wire, broad entryways| beneath balconies beneath spires| youthful head come to rest in meadow| beside bend in gravel road, still| body of milky liquid| her hair alight and so on| successive halls, flowered carpets and doors| or the photograph of nothing but pigeons| and grackles by the shadow of a fountain.| 
Aubade: Some Peaches, After Storm, by Carl Phillips| Poet| So that each| is its own, now--each has fallen, blond stillness.| Closer, above them,| the damselflies pass as they would over water,| if the fruit were water,| or as bees would, if they weren't| somewhere else, had the fruit found| already a point more steep| in rot, as soon it must, if| none shall lift it from the grass whose damp only| softens further those parts where flesh| goes soft.| | There are those| whom no amount of patience looks likely| to improve ever, I always said, meaning| gift is random,| assigned here,| here withheld--almost always| correctly| as it's turned out: how your hands clear| easily the wreckage;| how you stand--like a building for a time condemned,| then deemed historic. Yes. You| will be saved.| 
Crossing The Water, Sylvia Plath| Poet| Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.| Where do the black trees go that drink here?| Their shadows must cover Canada.| | A little light is filtering from the water flowers.| Their leaves do not wish us to hurry:| They are round and flat and full of dark advice.| | Cold worlds shake from the oar.| The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.| A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;| | Stars open among the lilies.| Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?| This is the silence of astounded souls.| 
Power, by Adrienne Rich| Poet| Living in the earth-deposits of our history| | Today a backhoe divulged out of a crumbling flank of earth| one bottle amber perfect a hundred-year-old| cure for fever or melancholy a tonic| for living on this earth in the winters of this climate.| | Today I was reading about Marie Curie:| she must have known she suffered from radiation sickness| her body bombarded for years by the element| she had purified| It seems she denied to the end| the source of the cataracts on her eyes| the cracked and suppurating skin of her finger-ends| till she could no longer hold a test-tube or a pencil| | She died a famous woman denying| her wounds| denying| her wounds came from the same source as her power.| 
Root Cellar, by Theodore Roethke| Poet| Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch,| Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark,| Shoots dangled and drooped,| Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates,| Hung down long yellow evil necks, like tropical snakes.| And what a congress of stinks!| Roots ripe as old bait,| Pulpy stems, rank, silo-rich,| Leaf-mold, manure, lime, piled against slippery planks.| Nothing would give up life:| Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath.| 
The Room of My Life, by Anne Sexton| Poet| Here,| in the room of my life| the objects keep changing.| Ashtrays to cry into,| the suffering brother of the wood walls,| the forty-eight keys of the typewriter| each an eyeball that is never shut,| the books, each a contestant in a beauty contest,| the black chair, a dog coffin made of Naugahyde,| the sockets on the wall| waiting like a cave of bees,| the gold rug| a conversation of heels and toes,| the fireplace| a knife waiting for someone to pick it up,| the sofa, exhausted with the exertion of a whore,| the phone| two flowers taking root in its crotch,| the doors| opening and closing like sea clams,| the lights| poking at me,| lighting up both the soil and the laugh.| The windows,| the starving windows| that drive the trees like nails into my heart.| Each day I feed the world out there| although birds explode| right and left.| I feed the world in here too,| offering the desk puppy biscuits.| However, nothing is just what it seems to be.| My objects dream and wear new costumes,| compelled to, it seems, by all the words in my hands| and the sea that bangs in my throat.| 
Her Kind, by Anne Sexton| Poet| I have gone out, a possessed witch,| haunting the black air, braver at night;| dreaming evil, I have done my hitch| over the plain houses, light by light:| lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.| A woman like that is not a woman, quite.| I have been her kind.| | I have found the warm caves in the woods,| filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,| closets, silks, innumerable goods;| fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:| whining, rearranging the disaligned.| A woman like that is misunderstood.| I have been her kind.| | I have ridden in your cart, driver,| waved my nude arms at villages going by,| learning the last bright routes, survivor| where your flames still bite my thigh| and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.| A woman like that is not ashamed to die.| I have been her kind.| 
Fork, by Charles Simic| Poet| This strange thing must have crept| Right out of hell.| It resembles a bird's foot| Worn around the cannibal's neck.| | As you hold it in your hand,| As you stab with it into a piece of meat,| It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:| Its head which like your fist| Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.| 
My Noiseless Entourage, by Charles Simic| Poet| We were never formally introduced.| I had no idea who among them was really I?| It was like a discreet entourage.| Each one about the same height.| Variously dressed we took the subway| Stealing peeks at each other over newspapers.| In moments of danger, they made themselves| scarce.| Where did they all disappear?| I asked some mugger one night| While he held a knife to my throat,| But he was spooked too,| Letting me go without a word,| Skipping over rain puddles| As if chased by his own shadow.| It was disconcerting, not to say criminal.| Flustered as I was, I reached| For the little black comb| I keep tucked in my breast pocket,| To run it through my hair once,| And make absolutely certain| At least one of us was still here.| 
Working Late, by Louis Simpson| Poet| A light is on in my father's study.| "Still up?" he says, and we are silent,| looking at the harbor lights,| listening to the surf| and the creak of coconut boughs.| | He is working late on cases.| No impassioned speech! He argues from evidence,| actually pacing out and measuring,| while the fans revolving on the ceiling| winnow the true from the false.| | Once he passed a brass curtain rod| through a head made out of plaster| and showed the jury the angle of fire--| where the murderer must have stood.| For years, all through my childhood,| if I opened a closet . . . bang!| There would be the dead man's head| with a black hole in the forehead.| | All the arguing in the world| will not stay the moon.| She has come all the way from Russia| to gaze for a while in a mango tree| and light the wall of a veranda,| before resuming her interrupted journey| beyond the harbor and the lighthouse| at Port Royal, turning away| from land to the open sea.| | Yet, nothing in nature changes, from that day to this,| she is still the mother of us all.| I can see the drifting offshore lights,| black posts where the pelicans brood.| | And the light that used to shine| at night in my father's study| now shines as late in mine.| 
Cleaning a Fish, by Dave Smith| Poet| In her hand the knife, brisk, brilliant as moon-claw,| shaves the flesh. It grazes the white| belly just over the heart.| Underneath, the coiled fingers| are cradling a soft flesh| as if it were the jowls of the aged| | man propped for a while on the bench in the park.| The head is not severed, the eyes not out.| Blue, they appear to flash odd ways| where a tree makes a live shadow.| Mostly the eyes are dead.| Nothing is in them| | except the intense blue of sky the tree allows.| There is no conspiring of nerves,| no least event recalled| by a limb's high arching,| or even a girl's ascension| from a forgotten distance of water.| | But there is something as she lifts the meat.| It is enough to draw down her gaze.| Now her arm rises against| yellow hair fallen| white in a childish face.| She is still as a leaf barely clinging.| | I come to her like a cat in the stunned grass| and touch her to see the startled,| upthrusted gleam of her face.| At brow and each cheek| like gathered beads of mist| scales leap with the sun, and are dead.| | No word passes between us, but something electric| as a flash of steel makes her| cry out just once. Squatting| at the yard's edge, she| sings beyond any thought.| Her knife flies as lethal as love| and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss.| 
Pacemaker, by W.D. Snodgrass| Poet| I| | "One Snodgrass, two Snodgrass, three Snodgrass, four . . .| I took my own rollcall when I counted seconds;| "One two three, Two two three, Three . . .," the drum score| Showed only long rests to the tympani's entrance.| | "Oh-oh-oh leff; leff; leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,"| The sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits;| The heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf,| Then AWOL, gets frogmarched to the noose.| | II| | Old coots, at the Veterans', might catch breath| If their cheeks got slapped by a nurse's aide,| Then come back to life; just so, at their birth,| Young rumps had been tendered warm accolades.| | The kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult,| The acid-fueled book review just might shock| Us back to the brawl like smelling salts,| Might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks.| | III| | I thought I'd always favor rubato| Or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms;| Thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress;| Believed one's bloodpump should skip a few beats| If it fell into company with sleek young women;| Believed my own bruit could beat with the best.| | Wrong again, Snodgrass! This new gold gadget,| Snug as the watch on my wife's warm wrist,| Drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace-| Go, nonstop startwatch! Go, clockwork rabbit,| Keeping this lame old dog synchronized,| Steady, sparked up, still in the race.| 
Hay for the Horses, by Gary Synder| Poet| He had driven half the night| From far down San Joaquin| Through Mariposa, up the| Dangerous Mountain roads,| And pulled in at eight a.m.| With his big truckload of hay| behind the barn.| With winch and ropes and hooks| We stacked the bales up clean| To splintery redwood rafters| High in the dark, flecks of alfalfa| Whirling through shingle-cracks of light,| Itch of haydust in the| sweaty shirt and shoes.| At lunchtime under Black oak| Out in the hot corral,| ---The old mare nosing lunchpails,| Grasshoppers crackling in the weeds---| "I'm sixty-eight" he said,| "I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.| I thought, that day I started,| I sure would hate to do this all my life.| And dammit, that's just what| I've gone and done."| 
Oranges, by Gary Soto| Poet| The first time I walked| With a girl, I was twelve,| Cold, and weighted down| With two oranges in my jacket.| December.  Frost cracking| Beneath my steps, my breath| Before me, then gone,| As I walked toward| Her house, the one whose| Porch light burned yellow| Night and day, in any weather.| A dog barked at me, until| She came out pulling| At her gloves, face bright| With rouge.  I smiled,| Touched her shoulder, and led| Her down the street, across| A used car lot and a line| Of newly planted trees,| Until we were breathing| Before a drugstore.  We| Entered, the tiny bell| Bringing a saleslady| Down a narrow aisle of goods.| I turned to the candies| Tiered like bleachers,| And asked what she wanted -| Light in her eyes, a smile| Starting at the corners| Of her mouth.  I fingered| A nickel in my pocket,| And when she lifted a chocolate| That cost a dime,| I didn't say anything.| I took the nickel from| My pocket, then an orange,| And set them quietly on| The counter.  When I looked up,| The lady's eyes met mine,| And held them, knowing| Very well what it was all| About.| | Outside,| A few cars hissing past,| Fog hanging like old| Coats between the trees.| I took my girl's hand| in mine for two blocks,| Then released it to let| Her unwrap the chocolate.| I peeled my orange| That was so bright against| The gray of December| That, from some distance,| Someone might have thought| I was making a fire in my hands.| 
Glass-Bottom Boat, by Elizabeth Spires| Poet| Key West| In the Cubano diner, tiny cups| of black, black coffee, hot and sweet,| and chipped blue china plates| of black beans and yellowtail,| fished by the fishermen| as the sun came up this morning.| | Yesterday out on the reef,| we looked through the floor of the boat,| through layers of clear, clean water-| windows looking into other windows-| down to the floor of the world,| shallow, pliant, and shifting.| There, schools of yellowtail| swam through the living coral,| bright as stained glass,| cast into underwater constellations| both strange and familiar:| a flower, a brain, a cathedral.| Suddenly a shadow parted the school-| as if a cloud had just blotted the sun-| a barracuda swerving as they swerved,| and nothing they could do.| After it fed, the two halves joined,| the missing ones unmourned,| all as it was before.| | If I could live for a thousand years,| ten thousand, would ever I see| the great family of men, women, and children,| both preying and preyed-upon,| swimming as freely as the yellowtail?| Would that be heaven or hell?| Each naked human face a candle| joining other candles in a procession| spanning many centuries, entering| the cathedral of live stone| whose heavy doors are cast| with scenes from our own lives,| moving as moving pictures move,| until the reel runs out.| In that world-without-end hour,| will the future read us in relief,| blindly touching each raised| and burnished scene with fingertips,| the ejaculate word forming on their lips,| an O! and then again an O!| of terror and astonishment?| O how will they sing knowing what they know?| Streaming through time, they see| our approach, we are plotted| in space, our light outlives our lives| and sends a signal far into| the future: the past is alive!| Dead and dark for a long time,| we are as stars to them,| stars wishing to be wished on.| 
Gin, by David St. John| Poet| There's a mystery| By the river, in one of the cabins| Shuttered with planks, its lock| Twisted; a bunch of magazines flipped open,| A body. A blanket stuffed with leaves| Or lengths of rope, an empty gin bottle.| Put down your newspaper. Look out| Beyond the bluffs, a coal barge is passing,| Its deck nearly| Level with the water, where it comes back riding| High. You start talking about nothing,| Or that famous party, where you went dressed| As a river. They listen,| The man beside you touching his odd face| In the countertop, the woman stirring tonic| In your glass. Down the bar the talk's divorce,| The docks, the nets| Filling with branches and sour fish. Listen,| I knew a woman who'd poke a hole in an egg, suck| It clean and fill the shell with gin,| Then walk around all day disgusting people| Until she was so drunk| The globe of gin broke in her hand. She'd stay| Alone at night on the boat, come back| Looking for another egg. That appeals to you, rocking| For hours carving at a hollow stone. Or finding| A trail by accident, walking the bluff's| Face. You know, your friends complain. They say| You give up only the vaguest news, and give a bakery| As your phone. Even your stories| Have no point, just lots of detail: The room| Was long and bright, small and close, angering Gaston;| They turned away to embrace him; She wore| The color out of season,| She wore hardly anything at all; Nobody died; Saturday.| These disguises of omission. Like forgetting| To say obtuse when you talk about the sun, leaving| Off the buttons as you're sewing up the coat. So,| People take the little| They know to make a marvelous stew;| Sometimes, it even resembles you. It's not so much| You cover your tracks, as that they bloom| In such false directions. This way friends who awaken| At night, beside you, awaken alone.| 
Traveling through the Dark, by William Stafford| Poet| Traveling through the dark I found a deer| dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.| It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:| that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.| | By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car| and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;| she had stiffened already, almost cold.| I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.| | My fingers touching her side brought me the reason--| her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,| alive, still, never to be born.| Beside that mountain road I hesitated.| | The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;| under the hood purred the steady engine.| I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;| around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.| | I thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,| then pushed her over the edge into the river.| 
Notice What This Poem Is Not Doing, by William Stafford| Poet| The light along the hills in the morning| comes down slowly, naming the trees| white, then coasting the ground for stones to nominate.| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | A house, a house, a barn, the old| quarry, where the river shrugs--| how much of this place is yours?| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | Every person gone has taken a stone| to hold, and catch the sun. The carving| says, "Not here, but called away."| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | The sun, the earth, the sky, all wait.| The crowns and redbirds talk. The light| along the hills has come, has found you.| | Notice what this poem has not done.| 
The Dancing, by Gerald Stern| Poet| In all these rotten shops, in all this broken furniture| and wrinkled ties and baseball trophies and coffee pots| I have never seen a post-war Philco| with the automatic eye| nor heard Ravel's "Bolero" the way I did| in 1945 in that tiny living room| on Beechwood Boulevard, nor danced as I did| then, my knives all flashing, my hair all streaming,| my mother red with laughter, my father cupping| his left hand under his armpit, doing the dance| of old Ukraine, the sound of his skin half drum,| half fart, the world at last a meadow,| the three of us whirling and singing, the three of us| screaming and falling, as if we were dying,| as if we could never stop--in 1945--| in Pittsburgh, beautiful filthy Pittsburgh, home| of the evil Mellons, 5,000 miles away| from the other dancing--in Poland and Germany--| oh God of mercy, oh wild God.| 
The Prediction, by Mark Strand| Poet| That night the moon drifted over the pond,| turning the water to milk, and under| the boughs of the trees, the blue trees,| a young woman walked, and for an instant| | the future came to her:| rain falling on her husband's grave, rain falling| on the lawns of her children, her own mouth| filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,| | a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it,| a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,| thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising| and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.| 
The Night, The Porch, by Mark Strand| Poet| To stare at nothing is to learn by heart| What all of us will be swept into, and baring oneself| To the wind is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by.| Trees can sway or be still. Day or night can be what they wish.| What we desire, more than a season or weather, is the comfort| Of being strangers, at least to ourselves. This is the crux| Of the matter. Even now we seem to be waiting for something| Whose appearance would be its vanishing--the sound, say,| Of a few leaves falling, or just one leaf, or less.| There is no end to what we can learn. The book out there| Tells as much, and was never written with us in mind.| 
Letter, by Jean Valentine| Poet| The hornet holds on to the curtain, winter| sleep. Rubs her legs. Climbs the curtain.| Behind her the cedars sleep lightly,| | like guests. But I am the guest.| The ghost cars climb the ghost highway. Even my hand| over the page       adds to the 'room tone': the little| | constant wind. The effort of becoming. These words| are my life. The effort| of loving the un-become. To make the suffering| | visible. The un-become love: What we| lost, a leaf, what we cherish, a leaf.| One leaf of grass. I'm sending you this seed-pod,| | this red ribbon, my tongue,| these two red ribbons, my mouth,| | my other mouth,| -but the other world-blindly I guzzle| the swimming milk of its seed field flower-| 
Year's End, by Ellen Bryant Voigt| Poet| The fingers lie in the lap,| separate, lonely, as in the field| the separate blades of grass| shrivel or grow tall.| | We sat together in the little room,| the walls blotched with steam,| holding the baby as if the two of us| could breathe for him and were not helpless.| Upstairs, his sister turned in her sleep| as the phone rang-| | to have wakened to a child's cry,| gagged and desperate,| and then repeat that terror when the call| split the quiet house and centered| its dire message:| a child was dead| and his mother so wrung by grief| she stared and stared| at the moon on its black stalk,| the road glistening like wire.| Rubbing the window clear of steam| as a child rubs sleep from its eyes,| and looking past the fence to where| he had plunged the sled up and down the hill,| we could still see the holes his feet made,| a staggered row of graves| extracting darkness from the snow.| When morning brought the new year in,| the fever broke, and fresh snow| bandaged the tracks on the hill.| For a long time we stayed in the room,| listening to him breathe,| like refugees who listen to the sea,| unable to fully rejoice, or fully grieve.| 
In Trackless Woods, by Richard Wilbur| Poet| In trackless woods, it puzzled me to find| Four great rock maples seemingly aligned,| As if they had been set out in a row| Before some house a century ago,| To edge the property and lend some shade.| I looked to see if ancient wheels had made| Old ruts to which the trees ran parallel,| But there were none, so far as I could tell -| There'd been no roadway. Nor could I find the square| Depression of a cellar anywhere,| And so I tramped on further, to survey| Amazing patterns in a hornbeam spray| Or spirals in a pine-cone, under trees| Not subject to our stiff geometries.| 
The Singing, by C. K. Williams| Poet| I was walking home down a hill near our house| on a balmy afternoon| under the blossoms| Of the pear trees that go flamboyantly mad here| every spring with| their burgeoning forth| | When a young man turned in from a corner singing| no it was more of| a cadenced shouting| Most of which I couldn't catch I thought because| the young man was| black speaking black| | It didn't matter I could tell he was making his| song up which pleased| me he was nice-looking| Husky dressed in some style of big pants obviously| full of himself| hence his lyrical flowing over| | We went along in the same direction then he noticed| me there almost| beside him and "Big"| He shouted-sang "Big" and I thought how droll| to have my height| incorporated in his song| | So I smiled but the face of the young man showed nothing| he looked| in fact pointedly away| And his song changed "I'm not a nice person"| he chanted "I'm not| I'm not a nice person"| | No menace was meant I gathered no particular threat| but he did want| to be certain I knew| That if my smile implied I conceived of anything like concord| between us I should forget it| | That's all nothing else happened his song became| indecipherable to| me again he arrived| Where he was going a house where a girl in braids| waited for him on| the porch that was all| | No one saw no one heard all the unasked and| unanswered questions| were left where they were| It occurred to me to sing back "I'm not a nice| person either" but I| couldn't come up with a tune| | Besides I wouldn't have meant it nor he have believed| it both of us| knew just where we were| In the duet we composed the equation we made| the conventions to| which we were condemned| | Sometimes it feels even when no one is there that| someone something| is watching and listening| Someone to rectify redo remake this time again though| no one saw nor| heard no one was there| 
More Blues and the Abstract Truth, by C.D. Write| Poet| I back the car over a soft, large object;| hair appears on my chest in dreams.| The paperboy comes to collect| with a pit bull. Call Grandmother| and she says, Well you know| death is death and none other.| | In the mornings we're in the dark;| even at the end of June| the zucchini keep on the sill.| Ring Grandmother for advice| and she says, O you know| I used to grow so many things.| | Then there's the frequent bleeding,| the tender nipples, and the rot| under the floormat. If I'm not seeing| a cold-eyed doctor it is| another gouging mechanic.| Grandmother says, Thanks to the blue rugs| and Eileen Briscoe's elms| the house keeps cool.| | Well. Then. You say Grandmother| let me just ask you this:| How does a body rise up again and rinse| her mouth from the tap. And how| does a body put in a plum tree| or lie again on top of another body| or string a trellis. Or go on drying| the flatware. Fix rainbow trout. Grout the tile.| Buy a bag of onions. Beat an egg stiff. Yes,| how does the cat continue| to lick itself from toenail to tailhole.| And how does a body break| bread with the word when the word| has broken. Again. And. Again.| With the wine. And the loaf.| And the excellent glass| of the body. And she says,| Even. If. The. Sky. Is. Falling.| My. Peace. Rose. Is. In. Bloom.| 
Approximately Forever, by C.D.

Clear Night, by Charles Wright| Poet| Clear night, thumb-top of a moon, a back-lit sky.| Moon-fingers lay down their same routine| On the side deck and the threshold, the white keys and the black keys.| Bird hush and bird song. A cassia flower falls.| | I want to be bruised by God.| I want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out.| I want to be stretched, like music wrung from a dropped seed.| I want to be entered and picked clean.| | And the wind says "What?" to me.| And the castor beans, with their little earrings of death, say "What?" to me.| And the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark.| And the gears notch and the engines wheel.| 
Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota, by James Wright| Poet| Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly,| Asleep on the black trunk,| Blowing like a leaf in green shadow.| Down the ravine behind the empty house,| The cowbells follow one another| Into the distances of the afternoon.| To my right,| In a field of sunlight between two pines,| The droppings of last year's horses| Blaze up into golden stones.| I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on.| A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home.| I have wasted my life.| 
A Blessing, by James Wright| Poet| Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,| Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.| And the eyes of those two Indian ponies| Darken with kindness.| They have come gladly out of the willows| To welcome my friend and me.| We step over the barbed wire into the pasture| Where they have been grazing all day, alone.| They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness| That we have come.| They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.| There is no loneliness like theirs.| At home once more,| They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.| I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,| For she has walked over to me| And nuzzled my left hand.| She is black and white,| Her mane falls wild on her forehead,| And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear| That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist.| Suddenly I realize| That if I stepped out of my body I would break| Into blossom.|

Turns And Movies: Zudora, by Conrad Aiken| 19th| Here on the pale beach, in the darkness;| With the full moon just to rise;| They sit alone, and look over the sea,| Or into each other's eyes. . .| | She pokes her parasol into the sleepy sand,| Or sifts the lazy whiteness through her hand.| | 'A lovely night,' he says, 'the moon,| Comes up for you and me.| Just like a blind old spotlight there,| Fizzing across the sea!'| | She pays no heed, nor even turns her head:| He slides his arm around her waist instead.| | 'Why don't we do a sketch together-| Those songs you sing are swell.| Where did you get them, anyway?| They suit you awfully well.'| | She will not turn to him-will not resist.| Impassive, she submits to being kissed.| | 'My husband wrote all four of them.| You know,-my husband drowned.| He was always sickly, soon depressed. . .'| But still she hears the sound| | Of a stateroom door shut hard, and footsteps going| Swiftly and steadily, and the dark sea flowing.| | She hears the dark sea flowing, and sees his eyes| Hollow with disenchantment, sick surprise,-| | And hate of her whom he had loved too well. . .| She lowers her eyes, demurely prods a shell.| | 'Yes. We might do an act together.| That would be very nice.'| He kisses her passionately, and thinks| She's carnal, but cold as ice.| 
The Window, by Conrad Aiken| 19th| She looks out in the blue morning| and sees a whole wonderful world| she looks out in the morning| and sees a whole world| | she leans out of the window| and this is what she sees| a wet rose singing to the sun| with a chorus of red bees| | she leans out of the window| and laughs for the window is high| she is in it like a bird on a perch| and they scoop the blue sky| | she and the window scooping| the morning as if it were air| scooping a green wave of leaves| above a stone stair| | and an urn hung with leaden garlands| and girls holding hands in a ring| and raindrops on an iron railing| shining like a harp string| | an old man draws with his ferrule| in wet sand a map of Spain| the marble soldier on his pedestal| draws a stiff diagram of pain| | but the walls around her tremble| with the speed of the earth the floor| curves to the terrestrial center| and behind her the door| | opens darkly down to the beginning| far down to the first simple cry| and the animal waking in water| and the opening of the eye| | she looks out in the blue morning| and sees a whole wonderful world| she looks out in the morning| and sees a whole world.| 
Before an Examination, by Stephen Vincent Benet| 19th| The little letters dance across the page,| Flaunt and retire, and trick the tired eyes;| Sick of the strain, the glaring light, I rise| Yawning and stretching, full of empty rage| At the dull maunderings of a long dead sage,| Fling up the windows, fling aside his lies;| Choosing to breathe, not stifle and be wise,| And let the air pour in upon my cage.| | The breeze blows cool and there are stars and stars| Beyond the dark, soft masses of the elms| That whisper things in windy tones and light.| They seem to wheel for dim, celestial wars;| And I -- I hear the clash of silver helms| Ring icy-clear from the far deeps of night.| 
Lonely Burial, by Stephen Vincent Benet| 19th| There were not many at that lonely place,| Where two scourged hills met in a little plain.| The wind cried loud in gusts, then low again.| Three pines strained darkly, runners in a race| Unseen by any. Toward the further woods| A dim harsh noise of voices rose and ceased.| -- We were most silent in those solitudes --| Then, sudden as a flame, the black-robed priest,| | The clotted earth piled roughly up about| The hacked red oblong of the new-made thing,| Short words in swordlike Latin -- and a rout| Of dreams most impotent, unwearying.| Then, like a blind door shut on a carouse,| The terrible bareness of the soul's last house.| 
Knowledge, by Louise Bogan| 19th| Now that I know| How passion warms little| Of flesh in the mould,| And treasure is brittle,--| | I'll lie here and learn| How, over their ground| Trees make a long shadow| And a light sound.| 
Weather, by Ambrose Bierce| 19th| Once I dipt into the future far as human eye could see,| And I saw the Chief Forecaster, dead as any one can be--| Dead and damned and shut in Hades as a liar from his birth,| With a record of unreason seldome paralleled on earth.| While I looked he reared him solemnly, that incandescent youth,| From the coals that he'd preferred to the advantages of truth.| He cast his eyes about him and above him; then he wrote| On a slab of thin asbestos what I venture here to quote--| For I read it in the rose-light of the everlasting glow:| "Cloudy; variable winds, with local showers; cooler; snow."| 
A Woman's Reason, by Gelett Burgess| 19th| I'm Sure every Word that you say is Absurd;| I Say it's All Gummidge and Twaddle;| You may Argue away till the 19th of May,| But I don't like the Sound of the Moddle!| 
The Goops by Gelett Burgess| 19th| The meanest trick I ever knew| Was one I know you never do.| I saw a Goop once try to do it,| And there was nothing funny to it.| He pulled a chair from under me| As I was sitting down; but he| Was sent to bed, and rightly, too.| It was a horrid thing to do!| 
The Sheep, by Ellis Parker Butler| 19th| The Sheep adorns the landscape rural| And is both singular and plural-| It gives grammarians the creeps| To hear one say, "A flock of sheeps."| | The Sheep is gentle, meek and mild,| And led in herds by man or child-| Being less savage than the rabbit,| Sheep are gregarious by habit.| | The Sheep grows wool and thus promotes| The making of vests, pants and coats-| Vests, pants and coats and woolen cloths| Provide good food for hungry moths.| | With vegetables added to| The Sheep, we get our mutton stew-| Experiments long since revealed| The Sheep should first be killed and peeled.| | Thus, with our debt to them so deep,| All men should cry "Praise be for Sheep!"-| And, if we happen to be shepherds,| "Praise be they're not as fierce as leopards!"| 
Cupid Caught Napping, by Ellis Parker Butler| 19th| Cupid on a summer day,| Wearied by unceasing play,| In a rose heart sleeping lay,| While, to guard the tricksy fellow,| Close above the fragrant bed| Back and forth a gruff bee sped,| And, to lull the sleepy head,| Played "Zoom! Zoom!" upon his 'cello.| | Little did the god surmise| That sweet Anna's cerule eyes| Gazed on him with glad surprise,| Or that he was in such danger;| But the watchman bee, in haste,| Left his post that he might taste| of the honey nature placed| On the lips of that fair stranger.| | Thus unwatched, from Cupid's side| Anna stole the boy god's pride,| All his love darts, and then hied| Far away from capture's chances| And today she wields the prize;| For Love's quiver still supplies| Darts that speed from Anna's eyes| In her love compelling glances!| 
In the desert, by Stephen Crane| 19th| In the desert| I saw a creature, naked, bestial,| Who, squatting upon the ground,| Held his heart in his hands,| And ate of it.| I said: "Is it good, friend?"| "It is bitter - bitter," he answered;| "But I like it| Because it is bitter,| And because it is my heart."| 
A god in wrath, by Stephen Crane| 19th| A god in wrath| Was beating a man;| He cuffed him loudly| With thunderous blows| That rang and rolled over the earth.| All people came running.| The man screamed and struggled,| And bit madly at the feet of the god.| The people cried,| "Ah, what a wicked man!"| And --| "Ah, what a redoubtable god!"| 
Upon the road of my life, by Stephen Crane| 19th| Upon the road of my life,| Passed me many fair creatures,| Clothed all in white, and radiant.| To one, finally, I made speech:| "Who art thou?"| But she, like the others,| Kept cowled her face,| And answered in haste, anxiously,| "I am good deed, forsooth;| You have often seen me."| "Not uncowled," I made reply.| And with rash and strong hand,| Though she resisted,| I drew away the veil| And gazed at the features of vanity.| She, shamefaced, went on;| And after I had mused a time,| I said of myself,| "Fool!"| 
Once, I knew a fine song, by Stephen Crane| 19th| Once, I knew a fine song,| -- It is true, believe me --| It was all of birds,| And I held them in a basket;| When I opened the wicket,| Heavens! They all flew away.| I cried, "Come back, little thoughts!"| But they only laughed.| They flew on| Until they were as sand| Thrown between me and the sky.| 
To Emily Dickinson, by Hart Crane| 19th| You who desired so much--in vain to ask--| Yet fed you hunger like an endless task,| Dared dignify the labor, bless the quest--| Achieved that stillness ultimately best,| | Being, of all, least sought for: Emily, hear!| O sweet, dead Silencer, most suddenly clear| When singing that Eternity possessed| And plundered momently in every breast;| | --Truly no flower yet withers in your hand.| The harvest you descried and understand| Needs more than wit to gather, love to bind.| Some reconcilement of remotest mind--| | Leaves Ormus rubyless, and Ophir chill.| Else tears heap all within one clay-cold hill.| 
Interior, by Hart Crane| 19th| It sheds a shy solemnity,| This lamp in our poor room.| O grey and gold amenity, --| Silence and gentle gloom!| | Wide from the world, a stolen hour| We claim, and none may know| How love blooms like a tardy flower| Here in the day's after-glow.| | And even should the world break in| With jealous threat and guile,| The world, at last, must bow and win| Our pity and a smile.| 
If I can stop one Heart from breaking, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| If I can stop one Heart from breaking| I shall not live in vain| If I can ease one Life the Aching| Or cool one Pain| | Or help one fainting Robin| Unto his Nest again| I shall not live in Vain.| 
I felt a Funeral, in my Brain, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| I felt a Funeral, in my Brain,| And Mourners to and fro| Kept treading -- treading -- till it seemed| That Sense was breaking through --| | And when they all were seated,| A Service, like a Drum --| Kept beating -- beating -- till I thought| My Mind was going numb --| | And then I heard them lift a Box| And creak across my Soul| With those same Boots of Lead, again,| Then Space -- began to toll,| | As all the Heavens were a Bell,| And Being, but an Ear,| And I, and Silence, some strange Race| Wrecked, solitary, here --| | And then a Plank in Reason, broke,| And I dropped down, and down --| And hit a World, at every plunge,| And Finished knowing -- then --| 
We lose -- because we win, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| We lose -- because we win --| Gamblers -- recollecting which| Toss their dice again!| 
Going to Heaven!, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| Going to Heaven!| I don't know when --| Pray do not ask me how!| Indeed I'm too astonished| To think of answering you!| Going to Heaven!| How dim it sounds!| And yet it will be done| As sure as flocks go home at night| Unto the Shepherd's arm!| | Perhaps you're going too!| Who knows?| If you should get there first| Save just a little space for me| Close to the two I lost --| The smallest "Robe" will fit me| And just a bit of "Crown" --| For you know we do not mind our dress| When we are going home --| | I'm glad I don't believe it| For it would stop my breath --| And I'd like to look a little more| At such a curious Earth!| I'm glad they did believe it| Whom I have never found| Since the might Autumn afternoon| I left them in the ground.| 
There is no Frigate like a Book, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| There is no Frigate like a Book| To take us Lands away| Nor any Coursers like a Page| Of prancing Poetry --| This Traverse may the poorest take| Without oppress of Toll --| How frugal is the Chariot| That bears the Human soul.| 
Life's Tragedy, by Paul Laurence Dunbar| 19th| It may be misery not to sing at all,| And to go silent through the brimming day;| It may be misery never to be loved,| But deeper griefs than these beset the way.| | To sing the perfect song,| And by a half-tone lost the key,| There the potent sorrow, there the grief,| The pale, sad staring of Life's Tragedy.| | To have come near to the perfect love,| Not the hot passion of untempered youth,| But that which lies aside its vanity,| And gives, for thy trusting worship, truth.| | This, this indeed is to be accursed,| For if we mortals love, or if we sing,| We count our joys not by what we have,| But by what kept us from that perfect thing.| 
Encouraged, by Paul Laurence Dunbar| 19th| Because you love me I have much achieved,| Had you despised me then I must have failed,| But since I knew you trusted and believed,| I could not disappoint you and so prevailed.| 
The Unlucky Apple, by Paul Laurence Dunbar| 19th| 'Twas the apple that in Eden| Caused our father's primal fall;| And the Trojan War, remember --| 'Twas an apple caused it all.| So for weeks I've hesitated,| You can guess the reason why,| For I want to tell my darling| She's the apple of my eye.| 
Evadne, by Hilda Doolittle| 19th| I first tasted under Apollo's lips,| love and love sweetness,| I, Evadne;| my hair is made of crisp violets| or hyacinth which the wind combs back| across some rock shelf;| I, Evadne,| was made of the god of light.| | His hair was crisp to my mouth,| as the flower of the crocus,| across my cheek,| cool as the silver-cress| on Erotos bank;| between my chin and throat,| his mouth slipped over and over.| | Still between my arm and shoulder,| I feel the brush of his hair,| and my hands keep the gold they took,| as they wandered over and over,| that great arm-full of yellow flowers.| 
Sheltered Garden, by Hilda Doolittle| 19th| I have had enough.| I gasp for breath.| | Every way ends, every road,| every foot-path leads at last| to the hill-crest --| then you retrace your steps,| or find the same slope on the other side,| precipitate.| | I have had enough --| border-pinks, clove-pinks, wax-lilies,| herbs, sweet-cress.| | O for some sharp swish of a branch --| there is no scent of resin| in this place,| no taste of bark, of coarse weeds,| aromatic, astringent --| only border on border of scented pinks.| | Have you seen fruit under cover| that wanted light --| pears wadded in cloth,| protected from the frost,| melons, almost ripe,| smothered in straw?| | Why not let the pears cling| to the empty branch?| All your coaxing will only make| a bitter fruit --| let them cling, ripen of themselves,| test their own worth,| nipped, shrivelled by the frost,| to fall at last but fair| with a russet coat.| | Or the melon --| let it bleach yellow| in the winter light,| even tart to the taste --| it is better to taste of frost --| the exquisite frost --| than of wadding and of dead grass.| | For this beauty,| beauty without strength,| chokes out life.| I want wind to break,| scatter these pink-stalks,| snap off their spiced heads,| fling them about with dead leaves --| spread the paths with twigs,| limbs broken off,| trail great pine branches,| hurled from some far wood| right across the melon-patch,| break pear and quince --| leave half-trees, torn, twisted| but showing the fight was valiant.| | O to blot out this garden| to forget, to find a new beauty| in some terrible| wind-tortured place.| 
A Noon Song, by Henry Van Dyke| 19th| There are songs for the morning and songs for the night,| For sunrise and sunset, the stars and the moon;| But who will give praise to the fulness of light,| And sing us a song of the glory of noon?| Oh, the high noon, the clear noon,| The noon with golden crest;| When the blue sky burns, and the great sun turns| With his face to the way of the west!| | How swiftly he rose in the dawn of his strength;| How slowly he crept as the morning wore by;| Ah, steep was the climbing that led him at length| To the height of his throne in the wide summer sky.| Oh, the long toil, the slow toil,| The toil that may not rest,| Till the sun looks down from his journey's crown,| To the wonderful way of the west!| | Then a quietness falls over meadow and hill,| The wings of the wind in the forest are furled,| The river runs softly, the birds are all still,| The workers are resting all over the world.| Oh, the good hour, the kind hour,| The hour that calms the breast!| Little inn half-way on the road of the day,| Where it follows the turn to the west!| | There's a plentiful feast in the maple-tree shade,| The lilt of a song to an old-fashioned tune,| The talk of a friend, or the kiss of a maid,| To sweeten the cup that we drink to the noon.| Oh, the deep noon, the full noon,| Of all the day the best!| When the blue sky burns, and the great sun turns| To his home by the way of the west.| 
God of the Open Air, by Henry Van Dyke| 19th| I| | Thou who hast made thy dwelling fair| With flowers beneath, above with starry lights,| And set thine altars everywhere,--| On mountain heights,| In woodlands dim with many a dream,| In valleys bright with springs,| And on the curving capes of every stream:| Thou who hast taken to thyself the wings| Of morning, to abide| Upon the secret places of the sea,| And on far islands, where the tide| Visits the beauty of untrodden shores,| Waiting for worshippers to come to thee| In thy great out-of-doors!| To thee I turn, to thee I make my prayer,| God of the open air.| | | II| | Seeking for thee, the heart of man| Lonely and longing ran,| In that first, solitary hour,| When the mysterious power| To know and love the wonder of the morn| Was breathed within him, and his soul was born;| And thou didst meet thy child,| Not in some hidden shrine,| But in the freedom of the garden wild,| And take his hand in thine,--| There all day long in Paradise he walked,| And in the cool of evening with thee talked.| | | III| | Lost, long ago, that garden bright and pure,| Lost, that calm day too perfect to endure,| And lost the childlike love that worshipped and was sure!| For men have dulled their eyes with sin,| And dimmed the light of heaven with doubt,| And built their temple walls to shut thee in,| And framed their iron creeds to shut thee out.| But not for thee the closing of the door,| O Spirit unconfined!| Thy ways are free| As is the wandering wind,| And thou hast wooed thy children, to restore| Their fellowship with thee,| In peace of soul and simpleness of mind.| | | IV| | Joyful the heart that, when the flood rolled by,| Leaped up to see the rainbow in the sky;| And glad the pilgrim, in the lonely night,| For whom the hills of Haran, tier on tier,| Built up a secret stairway to the height| Where stars like angel eyes were shining clear.| From mountain-peaks, in many a land and age,| Disciples of the Persian seer| Have hailed the rising sun and worshipped thee;| And wayworn followers of the Indian sage| Have found the peace of God beneath a spreading tree.| | But One, but One,--ah, child most dear,| And perfect image of the Love Unseen,--| Walked every day in pastures green,| And all his life the quiet waters by,| Reading their beauty with a tranquil eye.| | To him the desert was a place prepared| For weary hearts to rest;| The hillside was a temple blest;| The grassy vale a banquet-room| Where he could feed and comfort many a guest.| With him the lily shared| The vital joy that breathes itself in bloom;| And every bird that sang beside the nest| Told of the love that broods o'er every living thing.| He watched the shepherd bring| His flock at sundown to the welcome fold,| The fisherman at daybreak fling| His net across the waters gray and cold,| And all day long the patient reaper swing| His curving sickle through the harvest-gold.| So through the world the foot-path way he trod,| Drawing the air of heaven in every breath;| And in the evening sacrifice of death| Beneath the open sky he gave his soul to God.| Him will I trust, and for my Master take;| Him will I follow; and for his dear sake,| God of the open air,| To thee I make my prayer.| | | V| | From the prison of anxious thought that greed has builded,| From the fetters that envy has wrought and pride has gilded,| From the noise of the crowded ways and the fierce confusion,| From the folly that wastes its days in a world of illusion,| (Ah, but the life is lost that frets and languishes there!)| I would escape and be free in the joy of the open air.| | By the breadth of the blue that shines in silence o'er me,| By the length of the mountain-lines that stretch before me,| By the height of the cloud that sails, with rest in motion,| Over the plains and the vales to the measureless ocean,| (Oh, how the sight of the things that are great enlarges the eyes!)| Lead me out of the narrow life, to the peace of the hills| and the skies.| | While the tremulous leafy haze on the woodland is spreading,| And the bloom on the meadow betrays where May has been treading;| While the birds on the branches above, and the brooks flowing under,| Are singing together of love in a world full of wonder,| (Lo, in the marvel of Springtime, dreams are changed into truth!)| Quicken my heart, and restore the beautiful hopes of youth.| | By the faith that the flowers show when they bloom unbidden,| By the calm of the river's flow to a goal that is hidden,| By the trust of the tree that clings to its deep foundation,| By the courage of wild birds' wings on the long migration,| (Wonderful secret of peace that abides in Nature's breast!)| Teach me how to confide, and live my life, and rest.| | For the comforting warmth of the sun that my body embraces,| For the cool of the waters that run through the shadowy places,| For the balm of the breezes that brush my face with their fingers,| For the vesper-hymn of the thrush when the twilight lingers,| For the long breath, the deep breath, the breath| of a heart without care,--| I will give thanks and adore thee, God of the open air!| | | VI| | These are the gifts I ask| Of thee, Spirit serene:| Strength for the daily task,| Courage to face the road,| Good cheer to help me bear the traveller's load,| And, for the hours of rest that come between,| An inward joy in all things heard and seen.| These are the sins I fain| Would have thee take away:| Malice, and cold disdain,| Hot anger, sullen hate,| Scorn of the lowly, envy of the great,| And discontent that casts a shadow gray| On all the brightness of the common day.| | These are the things I prize| And hold of dearest worth:| Light of the sapphire skies,| Peace of the silent hills,| Shelter of forests, comfort of the grass,| Music of birds, murmur of little rills,| Shadow of clouds that swiftly pass,| And, after showers,| The smell of flowers| And of the good brown earth,--| And best of all, along the way, friendship and mirth.| | So let me keep| These treasures of the humble heart| In true possession, owning them by love;| And when at last I can no longer move| Among them freely, but must part| From the green fields and from the waters clear,| Let me not creep| Into some darkened room and hide| From all that makes the world so bright and dear;| But throw the windows wide| To welcome in the light;| And while I clasp a well-beloved hand,| Let me once more have sight| Of the deep sky and the far-smiling land,--| Then gently fall on sleep,| And breathe my body back to Nature's care,| My spirit out to thee, God of the open air.| 
Indian Summer, by Henry Van Dyke| 19th| A soft veil dims the tender skies,| And half conceals from pensive eyes| The bronzing tokens of the fall;| A calmness broods upon the hills,| And summer's parting dream distills| A charm of silence over all.| | The stacks of corn, in brown array,| Stand waiting through the placid day,| Like tattered wigwams on the plain;| The tribes that find a shelter there| Are phantom peoples, forms of air,| And ghosts of vanished joy and pain.| | At evening when the crimson crest| Of sunset passes down the West,| I hear the whispering host returning;| On far-off fields, by elm and oak,| I see the lights, I smell the smoke,--| The Camp-fires of the Past are burning.| 
Farewell and Thanksgiving, by Mark van Doren| 19th| Whatever I have left unsaid| When I am dead| O'muse forgive me.| You were always there,| like light, like air.| Those great good things| of which the least bird sings,| So why not I?| Yet thank you even then,| Sweet muse, Amen.| 
Macavity: The Mystery Cat, by T. S. Eliot| 19th| Macavity's a Mystery Cat: he's called the Hidden Paw--| For he's the master criminal who can defy the Law.| He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair:| For when they reach the scene of crime--Macavity's not there!| | Macavity, Macavity, there's no on like Macavity,| He's broken every human law, he breaks the law of gravity.| His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare,| And when you reach the scene of crime--Macavity's not there!| You may seek him in the basement, you may look up in the air--| But I tell you once and once again, Macavity's not there!| | Macavity's a ginger cat, he's very tall and thin;| You would know him if you saw him, for his eyes are sunken in.| His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly doomed;| His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed.| He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake;| And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake.| | Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity,| For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity.| You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square--| But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there!| | He's outwardly respectable. (They say he cheats at cards.)| And his footprints are not found in any file of Scotland Yard's.| And when the larder's looted, or the jewel-case is rifled,| Or when the milk is missing, or another Peke's been stifled,| Or the greenhouse glass is broken, and the trellis past repair--| Ay, there's the wonder of the thing! Macavity's not there!| | And when the Foreign Office finds a Treaty's gone astray,| Or the Admiralty lose some plans and drawings by the way,| There may be a scap of paper in the hall or on the stair--| But it's useless of investigate--Macavity's not there!| And when the loss has been disclosed, the Secret Service say:| "It must have been Macavity!"--but he's a mile away.| You'll be sure to find him resting, or a-licking of his thumbs,| Or engaged in doing complicated long division sums.| | Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macacity,| There never was a Cat of such deceitfulness and suavity.| He always has an alibit, or one or two to spare:| And whatever time the deed took place--MACAVITY WASN'T THERE!| And they say that all the Cats whose wicked deeds are widely known| (I might mention Mungojerrie, I might mention Griddlebone)| Are nothing more than agents for the Cat who all the time| Just controls their operations: the Napoleon of Crime!| 
The Boston Evening Transcript, by T. S. Eliot| 19th| THE READERS of the Boston Evening Transcript| Sway in the wind like a field of ripe corn.| | When evening quickens faintly in the street,| Wakening the appetites of life in some| And to others bringing the Boston Evening Transcript,| I mount the steps and ring the bell, turning| Wearily, as one would turn to nod good-bye to Rochefoucauld,| If the street were time and he at the end of the street,| And I say, "Cousin Harriet, here is the Boston Evening Transcript.| 
Give All To Love, by Ralph Waldo Emerson| 19th| Give all to love;| Obey thy heart;| Friends, kindred, days,| Estate, good fame,| Plans, credit, and the muse;| Nothing refuse.| | 'Tis a brave master,| Let it have scope,| Follow it utterly,| Hope beyond hope;| High and more high,| It dives into noon,| With wing unspent,| Untold intent;| But 'tis a god,| Knows its own path,| And the outlets of the sky.| 'Tis not for the mean,| It requireth courage stout,| Souls above doubt,| Valor unbending;| Such 'twill reward,| They shall return| More than they were,| And ever ascending.| | Leave all for love;-| Yet, hear me, yet,| One word more thy heart behoved,| One pulse more of firm endeavor,| Keep thee to-day,| To-morrow, for ever,| Free as an Arab| Of thy beloved.| Cling with life to the maid;| But when the surprise,| Vague shadow of surmise,| Flits across her bosom young| Of a joy apart from thee,| Free be she, fancy-free,| Do not thou detain a hem,| Nor the palest rose she flung| From her summer diadem.| | Though thou loved her as thyself,| As a self of purer clay,| Tho' her parting dims the day,| Stealing grace from all alive,| Heartily know,| When half-gods go,| The gods arrive.| 
The Park, by Ralph Waldo Emerson| 19th| The prosperous and beautiful| To me seem not to wear| The yoke of conscience masterful,| Which galls me everywhere.| | I cannot shake off the god;| On my neck he makes his seat;| I look at my face in the glass,| My eyes his eye-balls meet.| | Enchanters! enchantresses!| Your gold makes you seem wise:| The morning mist within your grounds| More proudly rolls, more softly lies.| | Yet spake yon purple mountain,| Yet said yon ancient wood,| That night or day, that love or crime| Lead all souls to the Good.| 
Threnody, by Ralph Waldo Emerson| 19th| The South-wind brings| Life, sunshine and desire,| And on every mount and meadow| Breathes aromatic fire;| But over the dead he has no power,| The lost, the lost, he cannot restore;| And, looking over the hills, I mourn| The darling who shall not return.| I see my empty house,| I see my trees repair their boughs;| And he, the wondrous child,| Whose silver warble wild| Outvalued every pulsing sound| Within the ear's cerulean round,--| The hyacinthine boy, for whom| Morn well might break and April bloom,| The gracious boy, who did adorn| The world whereinto he was born,| And by his countenance repay| The favor of the loving Day,--| Has disappeared from the Day's eye;| Far and wide she cannot find him;| My hopes pursue, they cannot bind him.| Returned this day, the South-wind searches,| And finds young pines and budding birches;| But finds not the budding man:| Nature, who lost, cannot remake him;| Fate let him fall, Fate can't retake him;| Nature, Fate, men, him seek in vain.| | And whither now, my truant wise and sweet,| 0, whither tend thy feet!| I had the right, few days ago,| Thy steps to watch, thy place to know:| How have I forfeited the right?| Hast thou forgot me in a new delight?| I hearken for thy household cheer,| O eloquent child!| Whose voice, an equal messenger,| Conveyed thy meaning mild.| What though the pains and joys| Whereof it spoke were toys| Fitting his age and ken,| Yet fairest dames and bearded men,| Who heard the sweet request,| So gentle, wise and grave,| Bended with joy to his behest| And let the world's affairs go by,| A while to share his cordial game,| Or mend his wicker wagon-frame,| Still plotting how their hungry ear| That winsome voice again might hear;| For his lips could well pronounce| Words that were persuasions.| Gentlest guardians marked serene| His early hope, his liberal mien;| Took counsel from his guiding eyes| To make this wisdom earthly wise.| Ah, vainly do these eyes recall| The school-march, each day's festival,| When every morn my bosom glowed| To watch the convoy on the road;| The babe in willow wagon closed,| With rolling eyes and face composed;| With children forward and behind,| Like Cupids studiously inclined;| And he the chieftain paced beside,| The centre of the troop allied,| With sunny face of sweet repose,| To guard the babe from fancied foes.| The little captain innocent| Took the eye with him as he went;| Each village senior paused to scan| And speak the lovely caravan.| From the window I look out| To mark thy beautiful parade,| Stately marching in cap and coat| To same tune by fairies played;--| A music heard by thee alone| To works as noble led thee on.| | Now Love and Pride, alas! in vain,| Up and down their glances strain.| The painted sled stands where it stood;| The kennel by the corded wood;| His gathered sticks to stanch the wall| Of the snow-tower, when snow should fall;| The ominous hole he dug in the sand,| And childhood's castles built or planned;| His daily haunts I well discern,--| The poultry-yard, the shed, the barn,--| And every inch of garden ground| Paced by the blessed feet around,| From the roadside to the brook| Whereinto he loved to look.| Step the meek fowls where erst they ranged;| The wintry garden lies unchanged;| The brook into the stream runs on;| But the deep-eyed boy is gone.| | On that shaded day,| Dark with more clouds than tempests are,| When thou didst yield thy innocent breath| In birdlike heavings unto death,| Night came, and Nature had not thee;| I said, "We are mates in misery."| The morrow dawned with needless glow;| Each snowbird chirped, each fowl must crow;| Each tramper started; but the feet| Of the most beautiful and sweet| Of human youth had left the hill| And garden,--they were bound and still.| There's nor a sparrow or a wren,| There's not a blade of autumn grain,| Which the four seasons do not tend| And tides of life and increase lend;| And every chick of every bird,| And weed and rock-moss is preferred.| O ostrich-like forgetfulnesr!| O loss of larger in the lessl| Was there no star that could be sent,| No watcher in the firmament,| No angel from the countless host| That loiters round the crystal coast,| Could stoop to heal that only child,| Nature's sweet marvel undefiled,| And keep the blossom of the earth,| Which all her harvests were nor worth?| Not mine,--I never called thee mine,| Bur Nature's heir,--if I repine,| And seeing rashly torn and moved| Nor what I made, but what I loved,| Grow early old with grief that thou| Must to the wastes of Nature go,--| 'Tis because a general hope| Was quenched, and all must doubt and grope.| For flattering planets seemed to say| This child should ills of ages stay,| By wondrous tongue, and guided pen,| Bring the flown Muses back to men.| Perchance not he but Nature ailed,| The world and nor the infant failed.| It was not ripe yet to sustain| A genius of so fine a strain,| Who gazed upon the sun and moon| As if he came unto his own,| And, pregnant with his grander thought,| Brought the old order into doubt.| His beauty once their beauty tried;| They could not feed him, and he died,| And wandered backward as in scorn,| To wait an aeon to be born.| Ill day which made this beauty waste,| Plight broken, this high face defaced!| Some went and came about the dead;| And some in books of solace read;| Same to their friends the tidings say;| Some went to write, some went to pray;| One tarried here, there hurried one;| But their heart abode with none.| Covetous death bereaved us all,| To aggrandize one funeral.| The eager fate which carried thee| Took the largest part of me:| For this Iosing is true dying;| This is lordly man's down-lying,| This his slow but sum reclining,| Star by star his world resigning.| | O child of paradise,| Boy who made dear his father's home,| In whose deep eyes| Men read the welfare of the times to come,| I am too much bereft.| The world dishonored thou hast left.| O truth's and nature's costly lid| O trusted broken prophecy!| O richest fortunes sourly crossed!| Born for the future, to the future lost!| | The deep Heart answered, "Weepest thou?| Worthier cause for passion wild| If I had not taken the child.| And deemest thou as those who pore,| With aged eyes, short way before,--| Think'st Beauty vanished from the coast| Of matter, and thy darling lost?| Taught he not thee--the man of eld,| Whose eyes within his eyes beheld| Heaven's numerous hierarchy span| The mystic gulf from God to man?| To be alone wilt thou begin| When worlds of lovers hem thee in?| Tomorrow, when the masks shall fall| That dizen Nature's carnival,| The pure shall see by their own will,| Which oveflowing. Love shall fill,| T is not within the force of fate| The fate-conjoined to separate.| But thou, my votary, weepest thou?| I gave thee sight--where is it now?| I taught thy heart beyond the reach| Of ritual, bible, or of speech;| Wrote in thy mind's transparent table,| As far as the incommunicable;| Taught thee each private sign to raise| Lit by the supersolar blaze.| Past utterance, and past belief,| And part the blasphemy of grief| The mysteries of Nature's heart;| And though no Muse can these impart,| Throb thine with Nature's throbbing breast| And all is clear from east to west.| | "I came to thee as to a friend;| Dearest, to thee I did not send| Tutors, but a joyful eye,| Innocence that matched the sky,| Lovely locks, a form of wonder,| Laughter rich as woodland thunder,| That thou might'st entertain apart| The richest flowering of all art:| And, as the great all-loving Day| Through smallest chambers takes its way,| That thou might'st break thy daily bread| With prophet, savior and head;| That thou might'st cherish for thine own| The riches of sweet Mary's Son,| Boy-Rabbi, Israel's paragon.| And thoughtest thou such guest| Would in thy hall take up his rest?| Would rushing life forget her laws,| Fare's glowing revolution pause?| High omens ask diviner guess;| Not to be conned to tediousness| And know my higher gifts unbind| The zone that girds the incarnate mind.| When the scanty shores are full| With Thought's perilous, whirling pool;| When frail Nature can no more,| Then the Spirit strikes the hour:| My servant Death, with solving rite,| Pours finite into infinite.| Wilt thou freeze love's tidal flow,| Whose streams through Nature circling go?| Nail the wild star to its track| On the half-climbed zodiac?| Light is light which radiates,| Blood is blood which circulates,| Life is life which generates,| And many-seeming life is one,--| Wilt thou transfix and make it none?| Its onward force too starkly pent| In figure, bone, and lineamenti| Wilt thou, uncalled, interrogate,| Talker! the unreplying Fate?| Nor see the genius of the whole| Ascendant in the private soul,| Beckon it when to go and came,| Self-announced its hour of doom?| Fair the soul's recess and shrine,| Magic-built to last a season;| Masterpiece of love benign,| Fairer that expansive reason| Whose omen't is, and sign.| Wilt thou not ope thy heart to know| What rainbows teach, and sunsets show?| Verdict which accumulates| From lengthening scroll of human fates,| Voice of earth to earth returned,| Prayers of saints that inly burned,--| Saying, What is excellent,| As God lives, is permanent;| Hearts are dust, hearts' loves remain;| Heart's love will meet thee again.| Revere the Maker fetch thine eye| Up to his style, and manners of the sky.| Not of adamant and gold| Built he heaven stark and cold;| No, but a nest of bending reeds,| Flowering grass and scented weeds;| Or like a traveller's fleeing tent,| Or bow above the tempest beet;| Built of tears and sacred ffames,| And virtue reaching to its aims;| Built of furtherance and pursuing,| Not of spent deeds, but of doing.| Silent rushes the swift Lord| Through ruined systems still restored,| Broadsowing, bleak and void to bless,| Plants with worlds the wilderness;| Waters with tears of ancient sorrow| Apples of Eden ripe to-merrow.| House and tenant go to ground,| Lost in God, in Godhead found."| 
The Road Not Taken, by Robert Frost| 19th| Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,| And sorry I could not travel both| And be one traveler, long I stood| And looked down one as far as I could| To where it bent in the undergrowth;| Then took the other, as just as fair,| And having perhaps the better claim,| Because it was grassy and wanted wear;| Though as for that the passing there| Had worn them really about the same,| And both that morning equally lay| In leaves no step had trodden black.| Oh, I kept the first for another day!| Yet knowing how way leads on to way,| I doubted if I should ever come back.| I shall be telling this with a sigh| Somewhere ages and ages hence:| Two roads diverged in a wood, and I-| I took the one less traveled by,| And that has made all the difference.| 
Mending Wall, by Robert Frost| 19th| Something there is that doesn't love a wall,| That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it| And spills the upper boulder in the sun,| And make gaps even two can pass abreast.| The work of hunters is another thing:| I have come after them and made repair| Where they have left not one stone on a stone,| But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,| To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,| No one has seen them made or heard them made,| But at spring mending-time we find them there,| I let my neighbor know beyond the hill;| And on a day we meet to walk the line| And set the wall between us once again.| We keep the wall between us as we go.| To each the boulders that have fallen to each.| And some are loaves and some so nearly balls| We have to use a spell to make them balance:| "Stay where you are until our backs are turned!"| We wear our fingers rough with handling them.| Oh, just another kind of outdoor game,| One on a side. It comes to little more:| There were it is we do not need the wall:| He is all pine and I am apple orchard.| My apple trees will never get across| And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.| He only says, "Good fences make good neighbors."| Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder| If I could put a notion in his head:| "Why do they make good neighbors? Isn't it| Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.| Before I built a wall I'd ask to know| What I was walling in or walling out,| And to whom I was like to give offense.| Something there is that doesn't love a wall,| That wants it down." I could say "Elves" to him,| But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather| He said it for himself. I see him there,| Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top| In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.| He moves in darkness as it seems to me,| Not of woods only and the shade of trees.| He will not go behind his father's saying,| And he likes having though of it so well| He says again, "Good fences make good neighbors."| 
My November Guest, by Robert Frost| 19th| My Sorrow, when she's here with me,| Thinks these dark days of autumn rain| Are beautiful as days can be;| She loves the bare, the withered tree;| She walks the sodden pasture lane.| | Her pleasure will not let me stay.| She talks and I am fain to list:| She's glad the birds are gone away,| She's glad her simple worsted grady| Is silver now with clinging mist.| | The desolate, deserted trees,| The faded earth, the heavy sky,| The beauties she so ryly sees,| She thinks I have no eye for these,| And vexes me for reason why.| | Not yesterday I learned to know| The love of bare November days| Before the coming of the snow,| But it were vain to tell he so,| And they are better for her praise.| 
A Valentine, by Eugene Field| 19th| Go, Cupid, and my sweetheart tell| I love her well.| Yes, though she tramples on my heart| And rends that bleeding thing apart;| And though she rolls a scornful eye| On doting me when I go by;| And though she scouts at everything| As tribute unto her I bring -| Apple, banana, caramel -| Haste, Cupid, to my love and tell,| In spite of all, I love her well!| | And further say I have a sled| Cushioned in blue and painted red!| The groceryman has promised I| Can "hitch" whenever he goes by -| Go, tell her that, and, furthermore,| Apprise my sweetheart that a score| Of other little girls implore| The boon of riding on that sled| Painted and hitched, as aforesaid; -| And tell her, Cupid, only she| Shall ride upon that sled with me!| Tell her this all, and further tell| I love her well.| 
Horace to phyllis, by Eugene Field| 19th| Come, Phyllis, I've a cask of wine| That fairly reeks with precious juices,| And in your tresses you shall twine| The loveliest flowers this vale produces.| | My cottage wears a gracious smile,--| The altar, decked in floral glory,| Yearns for the lamb which bleats the while| As though it pined for honors gory.| | Hither our neighbors nimbly fare,--| The boys agog, the maidens snickering;| And savory smells possess the air| As skyward kitchen flames are flickering.| | You ask what means this grand display,| This festive throng, and goodly diet?| Well, since you're bound to have your way,| I don't mind telling, on the quiet.| | 'Tis April 13, as you know,--| A day and month devote to Venus,| Whereon was born, some years ago,| My very worthy friend Maecenas.| | Nay, pay no heed to Telephus,--| Your friends agree he doesn't love you;| The way he flirts convinces us| He really is not worthy of you!| | Aurora's son, unhappy lad!| You know the fate that overtook him?| And Pegasus a rider had--| I say he had before he shook him!| | Haec docet (as you must agree):| 'T is meet that Phyllis should discover| A wisdom in preferring me| And mittening every other lover.| | So come, O Phyllis, last and best| Of loves with which this heart's been smitten,--| Come, sing my jealous fears to rest,| And let your songs be those I've written.| 
The Boys, by Oliver Wendell Holmes| 19th| HAS there any old fellow got mixed with the boys?| If there has, take him out, without making a noise.| Hang the Almanac's cheat and the Catalogue's spite!| Old Time is a liar! We're twenty to-night!| | We're twenty! We're twenty! Who says we are more?| He's tipsy,-- young jackanapes!-- show him the door!| "Gray temples at twenty?"-- Yes ! white if we please;| Where the snow-flakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze!| | Was it snowing I spoke of? Excuse the mistake!| Look close,-- you will see not a sign of a flake!| We want some new garlands for those we have shed,--| And these are white roses in place of the red.| | We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told,| Of talking (in public) as if we were old:--| That boy we call "Doctor," and this we call "Judge;"| It's a neat little fiction,-- of course it's all fudge.| | That fellow's the "Speaker,"-- the one on the right;| "Mr. Mayor," my young one, how are you to-night?| That's our "Member of Congress," we say when we chaff;| There's the "Reverend" What's his name?-- don't make me laugh.| | That boy with the grave mathematical look| Made believe he had written a wonderful book,| And the ROYAL SOCIETY thought it was true!| So they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too!| | There's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain,| That could harness a team with a logical chain;| When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire,| We called him "The Justice," but now he's "The Squire."| | And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith,--| Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;| But he shouted a song for the brave and the free,| Just read on his medal, "My country," "of thee!"| | You hear that boy laughing?-- You think he's all fun;| But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;| The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,| And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all!| | Yes, we're boys, --always playing with tongue or with pen,--| And I sometimes have asked,-- Shall we ever be men?| Shall we always be youthful, and laughing, and gay,| Till the last dear companion drops smiling away?| | Then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray!| The stars of its winter, the dews of its May!| And when we have done with our life-lasting toys,| Dear Father, take care of thy children, THE BOYS!| 
The Organ-Blower, by Oliver Wendell Holmes| 19th| DEVOUTEST of my Sunday friends,| The patient Organ-blower bends;| I see his figure sink and rise,| (Forgive me, Heaven, my wandering eyes!)| A moment lost, the next half seen,| His head above the scanty screen,| Still measuring out his deep salaams| Through quavering hymns and panting psalms.| | No priest that prays in gilded stole,| To save a rich man's mortgaged soul;| No sister, fresh from holy vows,| So humbly stoops, so meekly bows;| His large obeisance puts to shame| The proudest genuflecting dame,| Whose Easter bonnet low descends| With all the grace devotion lends.| | O brother with the supple spine,| How much we owe those bows of thine!| Without thine arm to lend the breeze,| How vain the finger on the keys!| Though all unmatched the player's skill,| Those thousand throats were dumb and still:| Another's art may shape the tone,| The breath that fills it is thine own.| | Six days the silent Memnon waits| Behind his temple's folded gates;| But when the seventh day's sunshine falls| Through rainbowed windows on the walls,| He breathes, he sings, he shouts, he fills| The quivering air with rapturous thrills;| The roof resounds, the pillars shake,| And all the slumbering echoes wake!| | The Preacher from the Bible-text| With weary words my soul has vexed| (Some stranger, fumbling far astray| To find the lesson for the day);| He tells us truths too plainly true,| And reads the service all askew,--| Why, why the-- mischief-- can't he look| Beforehand in the service-book?| | But thou, with decent mien and face,| Art always ready in thy place;| Thy strenuous blast, whate'er the tune,| As steady as the strong monsoon;| Thy only dread a leathery creak,| Or small residual extra squeak,| To send along the shadowy aisles| A sunlit wave of dimpled smiles.| | Not all the preaching, O my friend,| Comes from the church's pulpit end!| Not all that bend the knee and bow| Yield service half so true as thou!| One simple task performed aright,| With slender skill, but all thy might,| Where honest labor does its best,| And leaves the player all the rest.| | This many-diapasoned maze,| Through which the breath of being strays,| Whose music makes our earth divine,| Has work for mortal hands like mine.| My duty lies before me. Lo,| The lever there! Take hold and blow!| And He whose hand is on the keys| Will play the tune as He shall please.| 
End Of The World, by Robinson Jeffers| 19th| When I was young in school in Switzerland, about the time of the Boer War,| We used to take it for known that the human race| Would last the earth out, not dying till the planet died. I wrote a schoolboy poem| About the last man walking in stoic dignity along the dead shore| Of the last sea, alone, alone, alone, remembering all| His racial past. But now I don't think so. They'll die faceless in flocks,| And the earth flourish long after mankind is out.| 
Promise Of Peace, by Robinson Jeffers| 19th| The heads of strong old age are beautiful| Beyond all grace of youth. They have strange quiet,| Integrity, health, soundness, to the full| They've dealt with life and been tempered by it.| A young man must not sleep; his years are war,| Civil and foreign but the former's worse;| But the old can breathe in safety now that they are| Forgetting what youth meant, the being perverse,| Running the fool's gauntlet and being cut| By the whips of the five senses. As for me,| If I should wish to live long it were but| To trade those fevers for tranquillity,| Thinking though that's entire and sweet in the grave| How shall the dead taste the deep treasure they have?| 
A Dream, by Helen Hunt Jackson| 19th| I dreamed that I was dead and crossed the heavens,--| Heavens after heavens with burning feet and swift,--| And cried: "O God, where art Thou?" I left one| On earth, whose burden I would pray Thee lift."| | I was so dead I wondered at no thing,--| Not even that the angels slowly turned| Their faces, speechless, as I hurried by| (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned);| | Nor, at the first, that I could not find God,| Because the heavens stretched endlessly like space.| At last a terror siezed my very soul;| I seemed alone in all the crowded place.| | Then, sudden, one compassionate cried out,| Though like the rest his face from me he turned,| As I were one no angel might regard| (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned):| | "No moew in heaven than earth will he find God| Who does not know his loving mercy swift| But waits the moment consummate and ripe,| Each burden, from each human soul to lift."| | Though I was dead, I died again for shame;| Lonely, to flee from heaven again I turned;| The ranks of angels looked away from me| (Beneath my feet the golden pavements burned).| 
My Tenants, by Helen Hunt Jackson| 19th| I never had a title-deed| To my estate. But little heed| Eyes give to me, when I walk by| My fields, to see who occupy.| Some clumsy men who lease and hire| And cut my trees to feed their fire,| Own all the land that I possess,| And tax my tenants to distress.| And if I say I had been first,| And, reaping, left for them the worst,| That they were beggars at the hands| Of dwellers on my royal lands,| With idle laugh of passing scorn| As unto words of madness born,| They would reply| I do not care;| They cannot crowd the charméd air;| They cannot touch the bonds I hold| On all that they have bought and sold.| They can waylay my faithful bees,| Who, lulled to sleep, with fatal ease,| Are robbe. Is one day's honey sweet| Thus snatched? All summer round my feet| In golden drifts from plumy wings,| In shining drops on fragrant things| Free gift, it came to me. My corn,| With burnished banners, morn by morn,| Comes out to meet and honor me;| The glittering ranks spread royally| Far as I walk. When hasty greed| Tramples it down for food and seed,| I, with a certain veiled delight,| Hear half the crop is lost by blight.| | Letter of the law these may fulfil,| Plant where they like, slay what they will,| Count up their gains and make them great;| Nevertheless, the whole estate| Always belongs to me and mine.| We are the only royal line.| And though I have no title-deed| My tenants pay me royal heed| When our sweet fields I wander by| To see what strangers occupy.| 
Poets, by Joyce Kilmer| 19th| Vain is the chiming of forgotten bells| That the wind sways above a ruined shrine.| Vainer his voice in whom no longer dwells| Hunger that craves immortal Bread and Wine.| Light songs we breathe that perish with our breath| Out of our lips that have not kissed the rod.| They shall not live who have not tasted death.| They only sing who are struck dumb by God.| 
The Rainy Day, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow| 19th| The day is cold, and dark, and dreary| It rains, and the wind is never weary;| The vine still clings to the mouldering wall,| But at every gust the dead leaves fall,| And the day is dark and dreary.| | My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;| It rains, and the wind is never weary;| My thoughts still cling to the mouldering Past,| But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,| And the days are dark and dreary.| | Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;| Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;| Thy fate is the common fate of all,| Into each life some rain must fall,| Some days must be dark and dreary.| 
Woods in Winter, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow| 19th| When winter winds are piercing chill,| And through the hawthorn blows the gale,| With solemn feet I tread the hill,| That overbrows the lonely vale.| | O'er the bare upland, and away| Through the long reach of desert woods,| The embracing sunbeams chastely play,| And gladden these deep solitudes.| | Where, twisted round the barren oak,| The summer vine in beauty clung,| And summer winds the stillness broke,| The crystal icicle is hung.| | Where, from their frozen urns, mute springs| Pour out the river's gradual tide,| Shrilly the skater's iron rings,| And voices fill the woodland side.| | Alas! how changed from the fair scene,| When birds sang out their mellow lay,| And winds were soft, and woods were green,| And the song ceased not with the day!| | But still wild music is abroad,| Pale, desert woods! within your crowd;| And gathering winds, in hoarse accord,| Amid the vocal reeds pipe loud.| | Chill airs and wintry winds! my ear| Has grown familiar with your song;| I hear it in the opening year,| I listen, and it cheers me long.| 
The Three Kings, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow| 19th| Three Kings came riding from far away,| Melchior and Gaspar and Baltasar;| Three Wise Men out of the East were they,| And they travelled by night and they slept by day,| For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.| | The star was so beautiful, large, and clear,| That all the other stars of the sky| Became a white mist in the atmosphere,| And by this they knew that the coming was near| Of the Prince foretold in the prophecy.| | Three caskets they bore on their saddle-bows,| Three caskets of gold with golden keys;| Their robes were of crimson silk with rows| Of bells and pomegranates and furbelows,| Their turbans like blossoming almond-trees.| | And so the Three Kings rode into the West,| Through the dusk of night, over hill and dell,| And sometimes they nodded with beard on breast| And sometimes talked, as they paused to rest,| With the people they met at some wayside well.| | "Of the child that is born," said Baltasar,| "Good people, I pray you, tell us the news;| For we in the East have seen his star,| And have ridden fast, and have ridden far,| To find and worship the King of the Jews."| | And the people answered, "You ask in vain;| We know of no king but Herod the Great!"| They thought the Wise Men were men insane,| As they spurred their horses across the plain,| Like riders in haste, and who cannot wait.| | And when they came to Jerusalem,| Herod the Great, who had heard this thing,| Sent for the Wise Men and questioned them;| And said, "Go down unto Bethlehem,| And bring me tidings of this new king."| | So they rode away; and the star stood still,| The only one in the gray of morn| Yes, it stopped, it stood still of its own free will,| Right over Bethlehem on the hill,| The city of David where Christ was born.| | And the Three Kings rode through the gate and the guard,| Through the silent street, till their horses turned| And neighed as they entered the great inn-yard;| But the windows were closed, and the doors were barred,| And only a light in the stable burned.| | And cradled there in the scented hay,| In the air made sweet by the breath of kine,| The little child in the manger lay,| The child, that would be king one day| Of a kingdom not human but divine.| | His mother Mary of Nazareth| Sat watching beside his place of rest,| Watching the even flow of his breath,| For the joy of life and the terror of death| Were mingled together in her breast.| | They laid their offerings at his feet:| The gold was their tribute to a King,| The frankincense, with its odor sweet,| Was for the Priest, the Paraclete,| The myrrh for the body's burying.| | And the mother wondered and bowed her head,| And sat as still as a statue of stone;| Her heart was troubled yet comforted,| Remembering what the Angel had said| Of an endless reign and of David's throne.| | Then the Kings rode out of the city gate,| With a clatter of hoofs in proud array;| But they went not back to Herod the Great,| For they knew his malice and feared his hate,| And returned to their homes by another way.| 
Wapentake, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow| 19th| To Alfred Tennyson| | Poet! I come to touch thy lance with mine;| Not as a knight, who on the listed field| Of tourney touched his adversary's shield| In token of defiance, but in sign| Of homage to the mastery, which is thine,| In English song; nor will I keep concealed,| And voiceless as a rivulet frost-congealed,| My admiration for thy verse divine.| Not of the howling dervishes of song,| Who craze the brain with their delirious dance,| Art thou, O sweet historian of the heart!| Therefore to thee the laurel-leaves belong,| To thee our love and our allegiance,| For thy allegiance to the poet's art.| 
Before the Altar, by Amy Lowell| 19th| Before the Altar, bowed, he stands| With empty hands;| Upon it perfumed offerings burn| Wreathing with smoke the sacrificial urn.| Not one of all these has he given,| No flame of his has leapt to Heaven| Firesouled, vermilion-hearted,| Forked, and darted,| Consuming what a few spare pence| Have cheaply bought, to fling from hence| In idly-asked petition.| His sole condition| Love and poverty.| And while the moon| Swings slow across the sky,| Athwart a waving pine tree,| And soon| Tips all the needles there| With silver sparkles, bitterly| He gazes, while his soul| Grows hard with thinking of the poorness of his dole.| "Shining and distant Goddess, hear my prayer| Where you swim in the high air!| With charity look down on me,| Under this tree,| Tending the gifts I have not brought,| The rare and goodly things| I have not sought.| Instead, take from me all my life!| "Upon the wings| Of shimmering moonbeams| I pack my poet's dreams| For you.| My wearying strife,| My courage, my loss,| Into the night I toss| For you.| Golden Divinity,| Deign to look down on me| Who so unworthily| Offers to you:| All life has known,| Seeds withered unsown,| Hopes turning quick to fears,| Laughter which dies in tears.| The shredded remnant of a man| Is all the span| And compass of my offering to you.| "Empty and silent, I| Kneel before your pure, calm majesty.| On this stone, in this urn| I pour my heart and watch it burn,| Myself the sacrifice; but be| Still unmoved: Divinity."| From the altar, bathed in moonlight,| The smoke rose straight in the quiet night.| 
A Lady, by Amy Lowell| 19th| You are beautiful and faded| Like an old opera tune| Played upon a harpsichord;| Or like the sun-flooded silks| Of an eighteenth-century boudoir.| In your eyes| Smoulder the fallen roses of out-lived minutes,| And the perfume of your soul| Is vague and suffusing,| With the pungence of sealed spice-jars.| Your half-tones delight me,| And I grow mad with gazing| At your blent colours.| My vigour is a new-minted penny,| Which I cast at your feet.| Gather it up from the dust,| That its sparkle may amuse you.| 
Anticipation, by Amy Lowell| 19th| I have been temperate always,| But I am like to be very drunk| With your coming.| There have been times| I feared to walk down the street| Lest I should reel with the wine of you,| And jerk against my neighbours| As they go by.| I am parched now, and my tongue is horrible in my mouth,| But my brain is noisy| With the clash and gurgle of filling wine-cups.| 
Drying Their Wings, by Vachel Lindsay| 19th| What the Carpenter Said| | THE moon's a cottage with a door.| Some folks can see it plain.| Look, you may catch a glint of light,| A sparkle through the pane,| Showing the place is brighter still| Within, though bright without.| There, at a cosy open fire| Strange babes are grouped about.| The children of the wind and tide--| The urchins of the sky,| Drying their wings from storms and things| So they again can fly.| 
To Lady Jane, by Vachel Lindsay| 19th| Romance was always young.| You come today| Just eight years old| With marvellous dark hair.| Younger than Dante found you| When you turned| His heart into the way| That found the heavenly stair.| | Perhaps we must be strangers.| I confess| My soul this hour is Dante's,| And your care| Should be for dolls| Whose painted hands caress| Your marvellous dark hair.| | Romance, with moonflower face| And morning eyes,| And lips whose thread of scarlet prophesies| The canticles of a coming king unknown,| Remember, when you join him| On his throne,| Even me, your far off troubadour,| And wear| For me some trifling rose| Beneath your veil,| Dying a royal death,| Happy and pale,| Choked by the passion,| The wonder and the snare,| The glory and despair| That still will haunt and own| Your marvellous dark hair.| 
A Curse for Kings, by Vachel Lindsay| 19th| A curse upon each king who leads his state,| No matter what his plea, to this foul game,| And may it end his wicked dynasty,| And may he die in exile and black shame.| | If there is vengeance in the Heaven of Heavens,| What punishment could Heaven devise for these| Who fill the rivers of the world with dead,| And turn their murderers loose on all the seas!| | Put back the clock of time a thousand years,| And make our Europe, once the world's proud Queen,| A shrieking strumpet, furious fratricide,| Eater of entrails, wallowing obscene| | In pits where millions foam and rave and bark,| Mad dogs and idiots, thrice drunk with strife;| While Science towers above;--a witch, red-winged:| Science we looked to for the light of life,| | Curse me the men who make and sell iron ships| Who walk the floor in thought, that they may find| Each powder prompt, each steel with fearful edge,| Each deadliest device against mankind.| | Curse me the sleek lords with their plumes and spurs,| May Heaven give their land to peasant spades,| Give them the brand of Cain, for their pride's sake,| And felon's stripes for medals and for braids.| | Curse me the fiddling, twiddling diplomats,| Haggling here, plotting and hatching there,| Who make the kind world but their game of cards,| Till millions die at turning of a hair.| | What punishment will Heaven devise for these| Who win by others' sweat and hardihood,| Who make men into stinking vultures' meat,| Saying to evil still "Be thou my good"?| | Ah, he who starts a million souls toward death| Should burn in utmost hell a million years!| --Mothers of men go on the destined wrack| To give them life, with anguish and with tears:--| | Are all those childbed sorrows sneered away?| Yea, fools laugh at the humble christenings,| And cradle-joys are mocked of the fat lords:| These mothers' sons made dead men for the Kings!| | All in the name of this or that grim flag,| No angel-flags in all the rag-array--| Banners the demons love, and all Hell sings| And plays wild harps. Those flags march forth to-day!| 
City Visions, by Emma Lazarus| 19th| I| | As the blind Milton's memory of light,| The deaf Beethoven's phantasy of tone,| Wroght joys for them surpassing all things known| In our restricted sphere of sound and sight,--| So while the glaring streets of brick and stone| Vix with heat, noise, and dust from morn till night,| I will give rein to Fancy, taking flight| From dismal now and here, and dwell alone| With new-enfranchised senses. All day long,| Think ye 't is I, who sit 'twixt darkened walls,| While ye chase beauty over land and sea?| Uplift on wings of some rare poet's song| Where the wide billow laughs and leaps and falls,| I soar cloud-high, free as the winds are free.| | | II| | Who grasps the substance? who 'mid shadows strays?| He who within some dark-bright wood reclines,| 'Twixt sleep and waking, where the needled pines| Have cushioned al his couch with soft brown sprays?| He notes not how the living water shines,| Trembling along the cliff, a flickering haze,| Brimming a wine-bright pool, nor lifts his gaze| To read the ancient wonders and the signs.| Does he possess the actual, or do I,| Who paint on air more than his sense receives,| The glittering pine-tufts with closed eyes behold,| Breathe the strong resinous perfume, see the sky| Quiver like azure flame between the leaves,| And open unseen gates with key of gold?| 
The Taming of the Falcon, by Emma Lazarus| 19th| The bird sits spelled upon the lithe brown wrist| Of yonder turbaned fowler, who had lamed| No feather limb, but the winged spirit tamed| With his compelling eye. He need not trust| The silken coil, not set the thick-limed snare;| He lures the wanderer with his steadfast gaze,| It shrinks, it quails, it trembles yet obeys.| And, lo! he has enslaved the thing of air.| The fixed, insistent human will is lord| Of all the earth;--but in the awful sky| Reigns absolute, unreached by deed or word| Above creation; through eternity,| Outshining the sun's shield, the lightening's sword,| The might of Allah's unaverted eye.| 
A Dedication. To Charlotte Cushman, by Sidney Lanier| 19th| As Love will carve dear names upon a tree,| Symbol of gravure on his heart to be,| | So thought I thine with loving text to set| In the growth and substance of my canzonet;| | But, writing it, my tears begin to fall --| This wild-rose stem for thy large name's too small!| | Nay, still my trembling hands are fain, are fain| Cut the good letters though they lap again;| | Perchance such folk as mark the blur and stain| Will say, 'It was the beating of the rain;'| | Or, haply these o'er-woundings of the stem| May loose some little balm, to plead for them.| 
To Beethoven, by Sidney Lanier| 19th| In o'er-strict calyx lingering,| Lay music's bud too long unblown,| Till thou, Beethoven, breathed the spring:| Then bloomed the perfect rose of tone.| | O Psalmist of the weak, the strong,| O Troubadour of love and strife,| Co-Litanist of right and wrong,| Sole Hymner of the whole of life,| | I know not how, I care not why, --| Thy music sets my world at ease,| And melts my passion's mortal cry| In satisfying symphonies.| | It soothes my accusations sour| 'Gainst thoughts that fray the restless soul:| The stain of death; the pain of power;| The lack of love 'twixt part and whole;| | The yea-nay of Freewill and Fate,| Whereof both cannot be, yet are;| The praise a poet wins too late| Who starves from earth into a star;| | The lies that serve great parties well,| While truths but give their Christ a cross;| The loves that send warm souls to hell,| While cold-blood neuters take no loss;| | Th' indifferent smile that nature's grace| On Jesus, Judas, pours alike;| Th' indifferent frown on nature's face| When luminous lightnings strangely strike| | The sailor praying on his knees| And spare his mate that's cursing God;| How babes and widows starve and freeze,| Yet Nature will not stir a clod;| | Why Nature blinds us in each act| Yet makes no law in mercy bend,| No pitfall from our feet retract,| No storm cry out 'Take shelter, friend;'| | Why snakes that crawl the earth should ply| Rattles, that whoso hears may shun,| While serpent lightnings in the sky,| But rattle when the deed is done;| | How truth can e'er be good for them| That have not eyes to bear its strength,| And yet how stern our lights condemn| Delays that lend the darkness length;| | To know all things, save knowingness;| To grasp, yet loosen, feeling's rein;| To waste no manhood on success;| To look with pleasure upon pain;| | Though teased by small mixt social claims,| To lose no large simplicity,| And midst of clear-seen crimes and shames| To move with manly purity;| | To hold, with keen, yet loving eyes,| Art's realm from Cleverness apart,| To know the Clever good and wise,| Yet haunt the lonesome heights of Art;| | O Psalmist of the weak, the strong,| O Troubadour of love and strife,| Co-Litanist of right and wrong,| Sole Hymner of the whole of life,| | I know not how, I care not why,| Thy music brings this broil at ease,| And melts my passion's mortal cry| In satisfying symphonies.| | Yea, it forgives me all my sins,| Fits life to love like rhyme to rhyme,| And tunes the task each day begins| By the last trumpet-note of Time.| 
A Red Flower, by Claude McKay| 19th| Your lips are like a southern lily red,| Wet with the soft rain-kisses of the night,| In which the brown bee buries deep its head,| When still the dawn's a silver sea of light.| | Your lips betray the secret of your soul,| The dark delicious essence that is you,| A mystery of life, the flaming goal| I seek through mazy pathways strange and new.| | Your lips are the red symbol of a dream,| What visions of warm lilies they impart,| That line the green bank of a fair blue stream,| With butterflies and bees close to each heart!| | Brown bees that murmur sounds of music rare,| That softly fall upon the langourous breeze,| Wafting them gently on the quiet air| Among untended avenues of trees.| | O were I hovering, a bee, to probe| Deep down within your scented heart, fair flower,| Enfolded by your soft vermilion robe,| Amorous of sweets, for but one perfect hour!| 
On the Road, by Claude McKay| 19th| Roar of the rushing train fearfully rocking,| Impatient people jammed in line for food,| The rasping noise of cars together knocking,| And worried waiters, some in ugly mood,| Crowding into the choking pantry hole| To call out dishes for each angry glutton| Exasperated grown beyond control,| From waiting for his soup or fish or mutton.| At last the station's reached, the engine stops;| For bags and wraps the red-caps circle round;| From off the step the passenger lightly hops,| And seeks his cab or tram-car homeward bound;| The waiters pass out weary, listless, glum,| To spend their tips on harlots, cards and rum.| 
Silence, by Marianne Moore| 19th| My father used to say,| "Superior people never make long visits,| have to be shown Longfellow's grave| nor the glass flowers at Harvard.| Self reliant like the cat --| that takes its prey to privacy,| the mouse's limp tail hanging like a shoelace from its mouth --| they sometimes enjoy solitude,| and can be robbed of speech| by speech which has delighted them.| The deepest feeling always shows itself in silence;| not in silence, but restraint."| Nor was he insincere in saying, "Make my house your inn."| Inns are not residences.| 
Love Is Not All, by Edna St. Vincent Millay| 19th| Love is not all: it is not meat nor drink| Nor slumber nor a roof against the rain;| Nor yet a floating spar to men that sink| And rise and sink and rise and sink again;| Love can not fill the thickened lung with breath,| Nor clean the blood, nor set the fractured bone;| Yet many a man is making friends with death| Even as I speak, for lack of love alone.| It well may be that in a difficult hour,| Pinned down by pain and moaning for release,| Or nagged by want past resolution's power,| I might be driven to sell your love for peace,| Or trade the memory of this night for food.| It well may be. I do not think I would.| 
The Suicide, by Edna St. Vincent Millay| 19th| "Curse thee, Life, I will live with thee no more!| Thou hast mocked me, starved me, beat my body sore!| And all for a pledge that was not pledged by me,| I have kissed thy crust and eaten sparingly| That I might eat again, and met thy sneers| With deprecations, and thy blows with tears,-| Aye, from thy glutted lash, glad, crawled away,| As if spent passion were a holiday!| And now I go. Nor threat, nor easy vow| Of tardy kindness can avail thee now| With me, whence fear and faith alike are flown;| Lonely I came, and I depart alone,| And know not where nor unto whom I go;| But that thou canst not follow me I know."| | Thus I to Life, and ceased; but through my brain| My thought ran still, until I spake again:| | "Ah, but I go not as I came,-no trace| Is mine to bear away of that old grace| I brought! I have been heated in thy fires,| Bent by thy hands, fashioned to thy desires,| Thy mark is on me! I am not the same| Nor ever more shall be, as when I came.| Ashes am I of all that once I seemed.| In me all's sunk that leapt, and all that dreamed| Is wakeful for alarm,-oh, shame to thee,| For the ill change that thou hast wrought in me,| Who laugh no more nor lift my throat to sing| Ah, Life, I would have been a pleasant thing| To have about the house when I was grown| If thou hadst left my little joys alone!| I asked of thee no favor save this one:| That thou wouldst leave me playing in the sun!| And this thou didst deny, calling my name| Insistently, until I rose and came.| I saw the sun no more.-It were not well| So long on these unpleasant thoughts to dwell,| Need I arise to-morrow and renew| Again my hated tasks, but I am through| With all things save my thoughts and this one night,| So that in truth I seem already quite| Free,and remote from thee,-I feel no haste| And no reluctance to depart; I taste| Merely, with thoughtful mien, an unknown draught,| That in a little while I shall have quaffed."| | Thus I to Life, and ceased, and slightly smiled,| Looking at nothing; and my thin dreams filed| Before me one by one till once again| I set new words unto an old refrain:| | "Treasures thou hast that never have been mine!| Warm lights in many a secret chamber shine| Of thy gaunt house, and gusts of song have blown| Like blossoms out to me that sat alone!| And I have waited well for thee to show| If any share were mine,-and now I go| Nothing I leave, and if I naught attain| I shall but come into mine own again!"| | Thus I to Life, and ceased, and spake no more,| But turning, straightway, sought a certain door| In the rear wall. Heavy it was, and low| And dark,-a way by which none e'er would go| That other exit had, and never knock| Was heard thereat,-bearing a curious lock| Some chance had shown me fashioned faultily,| Whereof Life held content the useless key,| And great coarse hinges, thick and rough with rust,| Whose sudden voice across a silence must,| I knew, be harsh and horrible to hear,-| A strange door, ugly like a dwarf.-So near| I came I felt upon my feet the chill| Of acid wind creeping across the sill.| So stood longtime, till over me at last| Came weariness, and all things other passed| To make it room; the still night drifted deep| Like snow about me, and I longed for sleep.| | But, suddenly, marking the morning hour,| Bayed the deep-throated bell within the tower!| Startled, I raised my head,-and with a shout| Laid hold upon the latch,-and was without.| | Ah, long-forgotten, well-remembered road,| Leading me back unto my old abode,| My father's house! There in the night I came,| And found them feasting, and all things the same| As they had been before. A splendour hung| Upon the walls, and such sweet songs were sung| As, echoing out of very long ago,| Had called me from the house of Life, I know.| So fair their raiment shone I looked in shame| On the unlovely garb in which I came;| Then straightway at my hesitancy mocked:| "It is my father's house!" I said and knocked;| And the door opened. To the shining crowd| Tattered and dark I entered, like a cloud,| Seeing no face but his; to him I crept,| And "Father!" I cried, and clasped his knees, and wept.| | Ah, days of joy that followed! All alone| I wandered through the house. My own, my own,| My own to touch, my own to taste and smell,| All I had lacked so long and loved so well!| None shook me out of sleep, nor hushed my song,| Nor called me in from the sunlight all day long.| | I know not when the wonder came to me| Of what my father's business might be,| And whither fared and on what errands bent| The tall and gracious messengers he sent.| Yet one day with no song from dawn till night| Wondering, I sat, and watched them out of sight.| And the next day I called; and on the third| Asked them if I might go,-but no one heard.| Then, sick with longing, I arose at last| And went unto my father,-in that vast| Chamber wherein he for so many years| Has sat, surrounded by his charts and spheres.| "Father," I said, "Father, I cannot play| The harp that thou didst give me, and all day| I sit in idleness, while to and fro| About me thy serene, grave servants go;| And I am weary of my lonely ease.| Better a perilous journey overseas| Away from thee, than this, the life I lead,| To sit all day in the sunshine like a weed| That grows to naught,-I love thee more than they| Who serve thee most; yet serve thee in no way.| Father, I beg of thee a little task| To dignify my days,-'tis all I ask| Forever, but forever, this denied,| I perish."| "Child," my father's voice replied,| "All things thy fancy hath desired of me| Thou hast received. I have prepared for thee| Within my house a spacious chamber, where| Are delicate things to handle and to wear,| And all these things are thine. Dost thou love song?| My minstrels shall attend thee all day long.| Or sigh for flowers? My fairest gardens stand| Open as fields to thee on every hand.| And all thy days this word shall hold the same:| No pleasure shalt thou lack that thou shalt name.| But as for tasks-" he smiled, and shook his head;| "Thou hadst thy task, and laidst it by," he said.| 
Griffy the Cooper, by Edgar Lee Masters| 19th| The cooper should know about tubs.| But I learned about life as well,| And you who loiter around these graves| Think you know life.| You think your eye sweeps about a wide horizon, perhaps,| In truth you are only looking around the interior of your tub.| You cannot lift yourself to its rim| And see the outer world of things,| And at the same time see yourself.| You are submerged in the tub of yourself -| Taboos and rules and appearances,| Are the staves of your tub.| Break them and dispel the witchcraft| Of thinking your tub is life!| And that you know life!| 
Emily Sparks, by Edgar Lee Masters| 19th| Where is my boy, my boy --| In what far part of the world?| The boy I loved best of all in the school? --| I, the teacher, the old maid, the virgin heart,| Who made them all my children.| Did I know my boy aright,| Thinking of him as a spirit aflame,| Active, ever aspiring?| Oh, boy, boy, for whom I prayed and prayed| In many a watchful hour at night,| Do you remember the letter I wrote you| Of the beautiful love of Christ?| And whether you ever took it or not,| My boy, wherever you are,| Work for your soul's sake,| That all the clay of you, all of the dross of you,| May yield to the fire of you,| Till the fire is nothing but light!...| Nothing but light!| 
Poem in Prose, by Archibald MacLeish| 19th| This poem is for my wife.| I have made it plainly and honestly:| The mark is on it| Like the burl on the knife.| | I have not made it for praise.| She has no more need for praise| Than summer has| Or the bright days.| | In all that becomes a woman| Her words and her ways are beautiful:| Love's lovely duty,| the well-swept room.| | Wherever she is there is sun| And time and a sweet air:| Peace is there,| Work done.| | There are always curtains and flowers| And candles and baked bread| And a cloth spread| And a clean house.| | Her voice when she sings is a voice| At dawn by a freshening spring| Where the wave leaps in the wind| And rejoices.| | Wherever she is it is now.| It is here where the apples are:| Here in the stars,| In the quick hour.| | The greatest and richest good,| My own life to live in,| This she has given me --| | If giver could.| 
The Enthusiast, by Herman Melville| 19th| "Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him"| | Shall hearts that beat no base retreat| In youth's magnanimous years -| Ignoble hold it, if discreet| When interest tames to fears;| Shall spirits that worship light| Perfidious deem its sacred glow,| Recant, and trudge where worldlings go,| Conform and own them right?| | Shall Time with creeping influence cold| Unnerve and cow? The heart| Pine for the heartless ones enrolled| With palterers of the mart?| Shall faith abjure her skies,| Or pale probation blench her down| To shrink from Truth so still, so lone| Mid loud gregarious lies?| | Each burning boat in Caesar's rear,| Flames -No return through me!| So put the torch to ties though dear,| If ties but tempters be.| Nor cringe if come the night:| Walk through the cloud to meet the pall,| Though light forsake thee, never fall| From fealty to light.| 
Song, by Edgar Allan Poe| 19th| I SAW thee on thy bridal day -| When a burning blush came o'er thee,| Though happiness around thee lay,| The world all love before thee:| | And in thine eye a kindling light| (Whatever it might be)| Was all on Earth my aching sight| Of Loveliness could see.| | That blush, perhaps, was maiden shame -| As such it well may pass -| Though its glow hath raised a fiercer flame| In the breast of him, alas!| | Who saw thee on that bridal day,| When that deep blush would come o'er thee,| Though happiness around thee lay,| The world all love before thee.| 
The Valley Of Unrest, by Edgar Allan Poe| 19th| Once it smiled a silent dell| Where the people did not dwell;| They had gone unto the wars,| Trusting to the mild-eyed stars,| Nightly, from their azure towers,| To keep watch above the flowers,| In the midst of which all day| The red sunlight lazily lay.| Now each visitor shall confess| The sad valley's restlessness.| Nothing there is motionless-| Nothing save the airs that brood| Over the magic solitude.| Ah, by no wind are stirred those trees| That palpitate like the chill seas| Around the misty Hebrides!| Ah, by no wind those clouds are driven| That rustle through the unquiet Heaven| Uneasily, from morn till even,| Over the violets there that lie| In myriad types of the human eye-| Over the lilies there that wave| And weep above a nameless grave!| They wave:- from out their fragrant tops| Eternal dews come down in drops.| They weep:- from off their delicate stems| Perennial tears descend in gems.| 
A Fairly Sad Tale, by Dorothy Parker| 19th| I think that I shall never know| Why I am thus, and I am so.| Around me, other girls inspire| In men the rush and roar of fire,| The sweet transparency of glass,| The tenderness of April grass,| The durability of granite;| But me- I don't know how to plan it.| The lads I've met in Cupid's deadlock| Were- shall we say?- born out of wedlock.| They broke my heart, they stilled my song,| And said they had to run along,| Explaining, so to sop my tears,| First came their parents or careers.| But ever does experience| Deny me wisdom, calm, and sense!| Though she's a fool who seeks to capture| The twenty-first fine, careless rapture,| I must go on, till ends my rope,| Who from my birth was cursed with hope.| A heart in half is chaste, archaic;| But mine resembles a mosaic-| The thing's become ridiculous!| Why am I so? Why am I thus?| 
Dilemma, by Dorothy Parker| 19th| If I were mild, and I were sweet,| And laid my heart before your feet,| And took my dearest thoughts to you,| And hailed your easy lies as true;| Were I to murmur "Yes," and then| "How true, my dear," and "Yes," again,| And wear my eyes discreetly down,| And tremble whitely at your frown,| And keep my words unquestioning| My love, you'd run like anything!| | Should I be frail, and I be mad,| And share my heart with every lad,| But beat my head against the floor| What times you wandered past my door;| Were I to doubt, and I to sneer,| And shriek "Farewell!" and still be here,| And break your joy, and quench your trust-| I should not see you for the dust!| 
A Girl, by Ezra Pound| 19th| The tree has entered my hands,| The sap has ascended my arms,| The tree has grown in my breast-| Downward,| The branches grow out of me, like arms.| | Tree you are,| Moss you are,| You are violets with wind above them.| A child - so high - you are,| And all this is folly to the world.| 
Song of the Bowmen of Shu, by Ezra Pound| 19th| Here we are, picking the first fern-shoots| And saying: When shall we get back to our country?| Here we are because we have the Ken-nin for our foemen,| We have no comfort because of these Mongols.| We grub the soft fern-shoots,| When anyone says "Return," the others are full of sorrow.| Sorrowful minds, sorrow is strong, we are hungry and thirsty.| Our defence is not yet made sure, no one can let his friend return.| We grub the old fern-stalks.| We say: Will we be let to go back in October?| There is no ease in royal affairs, we have no comfort.| Our sorrow is bitter, but we would not return to our country.| What flower has come into blossom?| Whose chariot? The General's.| Horses, his horses even, are tired. They were strong.| We have no rest, trhee battles a month.| By heavn, his horses are tired.| The generals are on them, the soldiers are by them.| The horses are well trained, the generals have ivory arrows and| quivers ornamented with fish-skin.| The enemy is swift, we must be careful.| When we set out, the willows were drooping with spring,| We come back in the snow,| We go slowly, we are hungry and thirsty,| Our mind is full of sorrow, who will know of our grief?| | By Bunno, reputedly 1100 B. C.| 
Miniver Cheevy, by Edwin Arlington Robinson| 19th| Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,| Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;| He wept that he was ever born,| And he had reasons.| | Miniver loved the days of old| When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;| The vision of a warrior bold| Would set him dancing.| | Miniver sighed for what was not,| And dreamed, and rested from his labors;| He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot,| And Priam's neighbors.| | Miniver mourned the ripe renown| That made so many a name so fragrant;| He mourned Romance, now on the town,| And Art, a vagrant.| | Miniver loved the Medici,| Albeit he had never seen one;| He would have sinned incessantly| Could he have been one.| | Miniver cursed the commonplace| And eyed a khaki suit with loathing;| He missed the mediæval grace| Of iron clothing.| | Miniver scorned the gold he sought,| But sore annoyed was he without it;| Miniver thought, and thought, and thought,| And thought about it.| | Miniver Cheevy, born too late,| Scratched his head and kept on thinking;| Miniver coughed, and called it fate,| And kept on drinking.| 
Lancelot, by Edwin Arlington Robinson| 19th| Gawaine, aware again of Lancelot| In the King's garden, coughed and followed him;| Whereat he turned and stood with folded arms| And weary-waiting eyes, cold and half-closed-| Hard eyes, where doubts at war with memories| Fanned a sad wrath. "Why frown upon a friend?| Few live that have too many," Gawaine said,| And wished unsaid, so thinly came the light| Between the narrowing lids at which he gazed.| "And who of us are they that name their friends?"| Lancelot said. "They live that have not any.| Why do they live, Gawaine? Ask why, and answer."| | Two men of an elected eminence,| They stood for a time silent. Then Gawaine,| Acknowledging the ghost of what was gone,| Put out his hand: "Rather, I say, why ask?| If I be not the friend of Lancelot,| May I be nailed alive along the ground| And emmets eat me dead. If I be not| The friend of Lancelot, may I be fried| With other liars in the pans of hell.| What item otherwise of immolation| Your Darkness may invent, be it mine to endure| And yours to gloat on. For the time between,| Consider this thing you see that is my hand.| If once, it has been yours a thousand times;| Why not again? Gawaine has never lied| To Lancelot; and this, of all wrong days-| This day before the day when you go south| To God knows what accomplishment of exile-| Were surely an ill day for lies to find| An issue or a cause or an occasion.| King Ban your father and King Lot my father,| Were they alive, would shake their heads in sorrow| To see us as we are, and I shake mine| In wonder. Will you take my hand, or no?| Strong as I am, I do not hold it out| For ever and on air. You see-my hand."| Lancelot gave his hand there to Gawaine,| Who took it, held it, and then let it go,| Chagrined with its indifference.| "Yes, Gawaine,| I go tomorrow, and I wish you well;| You and your brothers, Gareth, Gaheris,-| And Agravaine; yes, even Agravaine,| Whose tongue has told all Camelot and all Britain| More lies than yet have hatched of Modred's envy.| You say that you have never lied to me,| And I believe it so. Let it be so.| For now and always. Gawaine, I wish you well.| Tomorrow I go south, as Merlin went,| But not for Merlin's end. I go, Gawaine,| And leave you to your ways. There are ways left."| "There are three ways I know, three famous ways,| And all in Holy Writ," Gawaine said, smiling:| "The snake's way and the eagle's way are two,| And then we have a man's way with a maid-| Or with a woman who is not a maid.| Your late way is to send all women scudding,| To the last flash of the last cramoisy,| While you go south to find the fires of God.| Since we came back again to Camelot| From our immortal Quest-I came back first-| No man has known you for the man you were| Before you saw whatever 't was you saw,| To make so little of kings and queens and friends| Thereafter. Modred? Agravaine? My brothers?| And what if they be brothers? What are brothers,| If they be not our friends, your friends and mine?| You turn away, and my words are no mark| On you affection or your memory?| So be it then, if so it is to be.| God save you, Lancelot; for by Saint Stephen,| You are no more than man to save yourself."| | "Gawaine, I do not say that you are wrong,| Or that you are ill-seasoned in your lightness;| You say that all you know is what you saw,| And on your own averment you saw nothing.| Your spoken word, Gawaine, I have not weighed| In those unhappy scales of inference| That have no beam but one made out of hates| And fears, and venomous conjecturings;| Your tongue is not the sword that urges me| Now out of Camelot. Two other swords| There are that are awake, and in their scabbards| Are parching for the blood of Lancelot.| Yet I go not away for fear of them,| But for a sharper care. You say the truth,| But not when you contend the fires of God| Are my one fear,-for there is one fear more.| Therefore I go. Gawaine, I wish you well."| | "Well-wishing in a way is well enough;| So, in a way, is caution; so, in a way,| Are leeches, neatherds, and astrologers.| Lancelot, listen. Sit you down and listen:| You talk of swords and fears and banishment.| Two swords, you say; Modred and Agravaine,| You mean. Had you meant Gaheris and Gareth,| Or willed an evil on them, I should welcome| And hasten your farewell. But Agravaine| Hears little what I say; his ears are Modred's.| The King is Modred's father, and the Queen| A prepossession of Modred's lunacy.| So much for my two brothers whom you fear,| Not fearing for yourself. I say to you,| Fear not for anything-and so be wise| And amiable again as heretofore;| Let Modred have his humor, and Agravaine| His tongue. The two of them have done their worst,| And having done their worst, what have they done?| A whisper now and then, a chirrup or so| In corners,-and what else? Ask what, and answer."| | Still with a frown that had no faith in it,| Lancelot, pitying Gawaine's lost endeavour| To make an evil jest of evidence,| Sat fronting him with a remote forbearance-| Whether for Gawaine blind or Gawaine false,| Or both, or neither, he could not say yet,| If ever; and to himself he said no more| Than he said now aloud: "What else, Gawaine?| What else, am I to say? Then ruin, I say;| Destruction, dissolution, desolation,| I say,-should I compound with jeopardy now.| For there are more than whispers here, Gawaine:| The way that we have gone so long together| Has underneath our feet, without our will,| Become a twofold faring. Yours, I trust,| May lead you always on, as it has led you,| To praise and to much joy. Mine, I believe,| Leads off to battles that are not yet fought,| And to the Light that once had blinded me.| When I came back from seeing what I saw,| I saw no place for me in Camelot.| There is no place for me in Camelot.| There is no place for me save where the Light| May lead me; and to that place I shall go.| Meanwhile I lay upon your soul no load| Of counsel or of empty admonition;| Only I ask of you, should strife arise| In Camelot, to remember, if you may,| That you've an ardor that outruns your reason,| Also a glamour that outshines your guile;| And you are a strange hater. I know that;| And I'm in fortune that you hate not me.| Yet while we have our sins to dream about,| Time has done worse for time than in our making;| Albeit there may be sundry falterings| And falls against us in the Book of Man."| | "Praise Adam, you are mellowing at last!| I've always liked this world, and would so still;| And if it is your new Light leads you on| To such an admirable gait, for God's sake,| Follow it, follow it, follow it, Lancelot;| Follow it as you never followed glory.| Once I believed that I was on the way| That you call yours, but I came home again| To Camelot-and Camelot was right,| For the world knows its own that knows not you;| You are a thing too vaporous to be sharing| The carnal feast of life. You mow down men| Like elder-stems, and you leave women sighing| For one more sight of you; but they do wrong.| You are a man of mist, and have no shadow.| God save you, Lancelot. If I laugh at you,| I laugh in envy and in admiration."| | The joyless evanescence of a smile,| Discovered on the face of Lancelot| By Gawaine's unrelenting vigilance,| Wavered, and with a sullen change went out;| And then there was the music of a woman| Laughing behind them, and a woman spoke:| "Gawaine, you said 'God save you, Lancelot.'| Why should He save him any more to-day| Than on another day? What has he done,| Gawaine, that God should save him?" Guinevere,| With many questions in her dark blue eyes| And one gay jewel in her golden hair,| Had come upon the two of them unseen,| Till now she was a russet apparition| At which the two arose-one with a dash| Of easy leisure in his courtliness,| One with a stately calm that might have pleased| The Queen of a strange land indifferently.| The firm incisive languor of her speech,| Heard once, was heard through battles: "Lancelot,| What have you done to-day that God should save you?| What has he done, Gawaine, that God should save him?| I grieve that you two pinks of chivalry| Should be so near me in my desolation,| And I, poor soul alone, know nothing of it.| What has he done, Gawaine?"| | With all her poise,| To Gawaine's undeceived urbanity| She was less queen than woman for the nonce,| And in her eyes there was a flickering| Of a still fear that would not be veiled wholly| With any mask of mannered nonchalance.| "What has he done? Madam, attend your nephew;| And learn from him, in your incertitude,| That this inordinate man Lancelot,| This engine of renown, this hewer down daily| Of potent men by scores in our late warfare,| Has now inside his head a foreign fever| That urges him away to the last edge| Of everything, there to efface himself| In ecstasy, and so be done with us.| Hereafter, peradventure certain birds| Will perch in meditation on his bones,| Quite as if they were some poor sailor's bones,| Or felon's jettisoned, or fisherman's,| Or fowler's bones, or Mark of Cornwall's bones.| In fine, this flower of men that was our comrade| Shall be for us no more, from this day on,| Than a much remembered Frenchman far away.| Magnanimously I leave you now to prize| Your final sight of him; and leaving you,| I leave the sun to shine for him alone,| Whiles I grope on to gloom. Madam, farewell;| And you, contrarious Lancelot, farewell."| 
Painted Head, by John Crowe Ransom| 19th| By dark severance the apparition head| Smiles from the air a capital on no| Column or a Platonic perhaps head| On a canvas sky depending from nothing;| | Stirs up an old illusion of grandeur| By tickling the instinct of heads to be| Absolute and to try decapitation| And to play truant from the body bush;| | But too happy and beautiful for those sorts| Of head (homekeeping heads are happiest)| Discovers maybe thirty unwidowed years| Of not dishonoring the faithful stem;| | Is nameless and has authored for the evil| Historian headhunters neither book| Nor state and is therefore distinct from tart| Heads with crowns and guilty gallery heads;| | Wherefore the extravagant device of art| Unhousing by abstraction this once head| Was capital irony by a loving hand| That knew the no treason of a head like this;| | Makes repentance in an unlovely head| For having vinegarly traduced the flesh| Till, the hurt flesh recusing, the hard egg| Is shrunken to its own deathlike surface;| | And an image thus. The body bears the head| (So hardly one they terribly are two)| Feeds and obeys and unto please what end?| Not to the glory of tyrant head but to| | The estate of body. Beauty is of body.| The flesh contouring shallowly on a head| Is a rock-garden needing body's love| And best bodiness to colorify| | The big blue birds sitting and sea-shell cats| And caves, and on the iron acropolis| To spread the hyacinthine hair and rear| The olive garden for the nightingales.| 
Happiness, by Carl Sandburg| 19th| I ASKED the professors who teach the meaning of life to tell| me what is happiness.| And I went to famous executives who boss the work of| thousands of men.| They all shook their heads and gave me a smile as though| I was trying to fool with them| And then one Sunday afternoon I wandered out along| the Desplaines river| And I saw a crowd of Hungarians under the trees with| their women and children| and a keg of beer and an| accordion.| 
Horse Fiddle, by Carl Sandburg| 19th| FIRST I would like to write for you a poem to be shouted in the teeth of a strong wind.| Next I would like to write one for you to sit on a hill and read down the river valley on a late summer afternoon, reading it in less than a whisper to Jack on his soft wire legs learning to stand up and preach, Jack-in-the-pulpit.| As many poems as I have written to the moon and the streaming of the moon spinners of light, so many of the summer moon and the winter moon I would like to shoot along to your ears for nothing, for a laugh, a song,| for nothing at all,| for one look from you,| for your face turned away| and your voice in one clutch| half way between a tree wind moan| and a night-bird sob.| Believe nothing of it all, pay me nothing, open your window for the other singers and keep it shut for me.| The road I am on is a long road and I can go hungry again like I have gone hungry before.| What else have I done nearly all my life than go hungry and go on singing?| Leave me with the hoot owl.| I have slept in a blanket listening.| He learned it, he must have learned it| From two moons, the summer moon,| And the winter moon| And the streaming of the moon spinners of light.| 
The Idea Of Order At Key West, by Wallace Stevens| 19th| She sang beyond the genius of the sea.| The water never formed to mind or voice,| Like a body wholly body, fluttering| Its empty sleeves; and yet its mimic motion| Made constant cry, caused constantly a cry,| That was not ours although we understood,| Inhuman, of the veritable ocean.| | The sea was not a mask. No more was she.| The song and water were not medleyed sound| Even if what she sang was what she heard,| Since what she sang was uttered word by word.| It may be that in all her phrases stirred| The grinding water and the gasping wind;| But it was she and not the sea we heard.| | For she was the maker of the song she sang.| The ever-hooded, tragic-gestured sea| Was merely a place by which she walked to sing.| Whose spirit is this? we said, because we knew| It was the spirit that we sought and knew| That we should ask this often as she sang.| | If it was only the dark voice of the sea| That rose, or even colored by many waves;| If it was only the outer voice of sky| And cloud, of the sunken coral water-walled,| However clear, it would have been deep air,| The heaving speech of air, a summer sound| Repeated in a summer without end| And sound alone. But it was more than that,| More even than her voice, and ours, among| The meaningless plungings of water and the wind,| Theatrical distances, bronze shadows heaped| On high horizons, mountainous atmospheres| Of sky and sea.| It was her voice that made| The sky acutest at its vanishing.| She measured to the hour its solitude.| She was the single artificer of the world| In which she sang. And when she sang, the sea,| Whatever self it had, became the self| That was her song, for she was the maker. Then we,| As we beheld her striding there alone,| Knew that there was never a world for her| Except the one she sang and, singing, made.| | Ramon Fernandez, tell me, if you know,| Why, when the singing ended and we turned| Toward the town, tell why the glassy lights,| The lights in the fishing boats at anchor there,| As the night descended, tilting in the air,| Mastered the night and portioned out the sea,| Fixing emblazoned zones and fiery poles,| Arranging, deepening, enchanting night.| | Oh! Blessed rage for order, pale Ramon,| The maker's rage to order words of sea| Words of the fragrant portals, dimly-starred,| And of ourselves and our origins,| In ghostlier demarcations, keener sounds.| 
Nomad Exquisite, by Wallace Stevens| 19th| As the immense dew of Florida| Brings forth| The big-finned palm| And green vine angering for life,| | As the immense dew of Florida| Brings forth hymn and hymn| From the beholder,| Beholding all these green sides| And gold sides of green sides,| | And blessed mornings,| Meet for the eye of the young alligator,| And lightning colors| So, in me, comes flinging| Forms, flames, and the flakes of flames.| 
Do You Remember Once, by Alan Seeger| 19th| Do you remember once, in Paris of glad faces,| The night we wandered off under the third moon's rays| And, leaving far behind bright streets and busy places,| Stood where the Seine flowed down between its quiet quais?| | | The city's voice was hushed; the placid, lustrous waters| Mirrored the walls across where orange windows burned.| Out of the starry south provoking rumors brought us| Far promise of the spring already northward turned.| | | And breast drew near to breast, and round its soft desire| My arm uncertain stole and clung there unrepelled.| I thought that nevermore my heart would hover nigher| To the last flower of bliss that Nature's garden held.| | | There, in your beauty's sweet abandonment to pleasure,| The mute, half-open lips and tender, wondering eyes,| I saw embodied first smile back on me the treasure| Long sought across the seas and back of summer skies.| | | Dear face, when courted Death shall claim my limbs and find them| Laid in some desert place, alone or where the tides| Of war's tumultuous waves on the wet sands behind them| Leave rifts of gasping life when their red flood subsides,| | | Out of the past's remote delirious abysses| Shine forth once more as then you shone, -- beloved head,| Laid back in ecstasy between our blinding kisses,| Transfigured with the bliss of being so coveted.| | | And my sick arms will part, and though hot fever sear it,| My mouth will curve again with the old, tender flame.| And darkness will come down, still finding in my spirit| The dream of your brief love, and on my lips your name.| | II| | | You loved me on that moonlit night long since.| You were my queen and I the charming prince| Elected from a world of mortal men.| You loved me once. . . . What pity was it, then,| You loved not Love. . . . Deep in the emerald west,| Like a returning caravel caressed| By breezes that load all the ambient airs| With clinging fragrance of the bales it bears| From harbors where the caravans come down,| I see over the roof-tops of the town| The new moon back again, but shall not see| The joy that once it had in store for me,| Nor know again the voice upon the stair,| The little studio in the candle-glare,| And all that makes in word and touch and glance| The bliss of the first nights of a romance| When will to love and be beloved casts out| The want to question or the will to doubt.| You loved me once. . . . Under the western seas| The pale moon settles and the Pleiades.| The firelight sinks; outside the night-winds moan --| The hour advances, and I sleep alone.| | | | III| | | Farewell, dear heart, enough of vain despairing!| If I have erred I plead but one excuse --| The jewel were a lesser joy in wearing| That cost a lesser agony to lose.| | | I had not bid for beautifuller hours| Had I not found the door so near unsealed,| Nor hoped, had you not filled my arms with flowers,| For that one flower that bloomed too far afield.| | | If I have wept, it was because, forsaken,| I felt perhaps more poignantly than some| The blank eternity from which we waken| And all the blank eternity to come.| | | And I betrayed how sweet a thing and tender| (In the regret with which my lip was curled)| Seemed in its tragic, momentary splendor| My transit through the beauty of the world.| 
To England at the Outbreak of the Balkan War, by Alan Seeger| 19th| A cloud has lowered that shall not soon pass o'er.| The world takes sides: whether for impious aims| With Tyranny whose bloody toll enflames| A generous people to heroic war;| Whether with Freedom, stretched in her own gore,| Whose pleading hands and suppliant distress| Still offer hearts that thirst for Righteousness| A glorious cause to strike or perish for.| England, which side is thine? Thou hast had sons| Would shrink not from the choice however grim,| Were Justice trampled on and Courage downed;| Which will they be -- cravens or champions?| Oh, if a doubt intrude, remember him| Whose death made Missolonghi holy ground.| 
After Love, by Sara Teasdale| 19th| There is no magic any more,| We meet as other people do,| You work no miracle for me| Nor I for you.| | You were the wind and I the sea --| There is no splendor any more,| I have grown listless as the pool| Beside the shore.| | But though the pool is safe from storm| And from the tide has found surcease,| It grows more bitter than the sea,| For all its peace.| 
The Years, by Sara Teasdale| 19th| To-night I close my eyes and see| A strange procession passing me --| The years before I saw your face| Go by me with a wistful grace;| They pass, the sensitive, shy years,| As one who strives to dance, half blind with tears.| | The years went by and never knew| That each one brought me nearer you;| Their path was narrow and apart| And yet it led me to your heart --| Oh, sensitive, shy years, oh, lonely years,| That strove to sing with voices drowned in tears.| 
Prayer, by Henry David Thoreau| 19th| Great God, I ask for no meaner pelf| Than that I may not disappoint myself,| That in my action I may soar as high| As I can now discern with this clear eye.| And next in value, which thy kindness lends,| That I may greatly disappoint my friends,| Howe'er they think or hope that it may be,| They may not dream how thou'st distinguished me.| | That my weak hand may equal my firm faith| And my life practice what my tongue saith| That my low conduct may not show| Nor my relenting lines| That I thy purpose did not know| Or overrated thy designs.| 
Tell Me, by Jean Toomer| 19th| Tell me, dear beauty of the dusk,| When purple ribbons bind the hill,| Do dreams your secret wish fulfill,| Do prayers, like kernels from the husk| Come from your lips? Tell me if when| The mountains loom at night, giant shades| Of softer shadow, swift like blades| Of grass seeds come to flower. Then| Tell me if the night winds bend| Them towards me, if the Shenandoah| As it ripples past your shore,| Catches the soul of what you send.| 
O Captain! My Captain!, by Walt Whitman| 19th| 1| O CAPTAIN! my Captain! our fearful trip is done;| The ship has weather'd every rack, the prize we sought is won;| The port is near, the bells I hear, the people all exulting,| While follow eyes the steady keel, the vessel grim and daring:| But O heart! heart! heart!| O the bleeding drops of red,| Where on the deck my Captain lies,| Fallen cold and dead.| | 2| O Captain! my Captain! rise up and hear the bells;| Rise up-for you the flag is flung-for you the bugle trills;| For you bouquets and ribbon'd wreaths-for you the shores a-crowding;| For you they call, the swaying mass, their eager faces turning;| Here Captain! dear father!| This arm beneath your head;| It is some dream that on the deck,| You've fallen cold and dead.| | 3| My Captain does not answer, his lips are pale and still;| My father does not feel my arm, he has no pulse nor will;| The ship is anchor'd safe and sound, its voyage closed and done;| From fearful trip, the victor ship, comes in with object won;| Exult, O shores, and ring, O bells!| But I, with mournful tread,| Walk the deck my Captain lies,| Fallen cold and dead.| 
Beginners, by Walt Whitman| 19th| HOW they are provided for upon the earth, (appearing at intervals;)| How dear and dreadful they are to the earth;| How they inure to themselves as much as to any-What a paradox appears their age;| How people respond to them, yet know them not;| How there is something relentless in their fate, all times;| How all times mischoose the objects of their adulation and reward,| And how the same inexorable price must still be paid for the same great purchase.| 
Inscription, by Walt Whitman| 19th| SMALL is the theme of the following Chant, yet the greatest-namely,| One's-Self-that wondrous thing a simple, separate person. That, for the use of| the| New World, I sing.| Man's physiology complete, from top to toe, I sing. Not physiognomy alone, nor brain| alone, is worthy for the muse;-I say the Form complete is worthier far. The female| equal| with the male, I sing,| Nor cease at the theme of One's-Self. I speak the word of the modern, the word| En-Masse:| My Days I sing, and the Lands-with interstice I knew of hapless War.| | O friend whoe'er you are, at last arriving hither to commence, I feel through every| leaf| the pressure of your hand, which I return. And thus upon our journey link'd together| let| us go.| 
A Sort Of A Song, by William Carlos Williams| 19th| Let the snake wait under| his weed| and the writing| be of words, slow and quick, sharp| to strike, quiet to wait,| sleepless.| -through metaphor to reconcile| the people and the stones.| Compose. (No ideas| but in things) Invent!| Saxifrage is my flower that splits| the rocks.| 
Portrait Of A Lady, by William Carlos Williams| 19th| Your thighs are appletrees| whose blossoms touch the sky.| Which sky? The sky| where Watteau hung a lady's| slipper. Your knees| are a southern breeze-or| a gust of snow. Agh! what| sort of man was Fragonard?| -As if that answered| anything.-Ah, yes. Below| the knees, since the tune| drops that way, it is| one of those white summer days,| the tall grass of your ankles| flickers upon the shore-| Which shore?-| the sand clings to my lips-| Which shore?| Agh, petals maybe. How| should I know?| Which shore? Which shore?| -the petals from some hidden| appletree-Which shore?| I said petals from an appletree.| 
A Golden Day, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox| 19th| The subtle beauty of this day| Hangs o'er me like a fairy spell,| And care and grief have flown away,| And every breeze sings, "all is well."| I ask, "Holds earth or sin, or woe?"| My heart replies, "I do not know."| | Nay! all we know, or feel, my heart,| Today is joy undimmed, complete;| In tears or pain we have no part;| The act of breathing is so sweet,| We care no higher joy to name.| What reck we now of wealth or fame?| | The past--what matters it to me?| The pain it gave has passed away.| The future--that I cannot see!| I care for nothing save today--| This is a respite from all care,| And trouble flies--I know not where.| | Go on, oh noisy, restless life!| Pass by, oh, feet that seek for heights!| I have no part in aught of strife;| I do not want your vain delights.| The day wraps round me like a spell| And every breeze sings, "All is well."| 
Our Blessings, by Ella Wheeler Wilcox| 19th| Sitting to-day in the sunshine,| That touched me with fingers of love,| I thought of the manifold blessings| God scatters on earth, from above;| And they seemed, as I numbered them over,| Far more than we merit, or need,| And all that we lack is the angels| To make earth a heaven indeed.| | The winter brings long, pleasant evenings,| The spring brings a promise of flowers| That summer breathes to fruition,| And autumn brings glad, golden hours.| The woodlands re-echo with music,| The moonbeams ensilver the sea;| There is sunlight and beauty about us,| And the world is as fair as can be.| | But mortals are always complaining,| Each one thinks his own a sad lot;| And forgetting the good things about him,| Goes mourning for those he has not.| Instead of the star-spangled heavens,| We look on the dust at our feet;| We drain out the cup that is bitter,| Forgetting the one that is sweet.| | We mourn o'er the thorn in the flower,| Forgetting its odour and bloom;| We pass by a garden of blossoms,| To weep o'er the dust of the tomb.| There are blessings unnumbered about us, -| Like the leaves of the forest they grow;| And the fault is our own - not the Giver's -| That we have not an Eden below.| 
A Word for the Hour, by John Greenleaf Whittier| 19th| The firmament breaks up. In black eclipse| Light after light goes out. One evil star,| Luridly glaring through the smoke of war,| As in the dream of the Apocalypse,| Drags others down. Let us not weakly weep| Nor rashly threaten. Give us grace to keep| Our faith and patience; wherefore should we leap| On one hand into fratricidal fight,| Or, on the other, yield eternal right,| Frame lies of laws, and good and ill confound?| What fear we? Safe on freedom's vantage ground| Our feet are planted; let us there remain| In unrevengeful calm, no means untried| Which truth can sanction, no just claim denied,| The sad spectators of a suicide!| They break the lines of Union: shall we light| The fires of hell to weld anew the chain| On that red anvil where each blow is pain?| Draw we not even now a freer breath,| As from our shoulders falls a load of death| Loathsome as that the Tuscan's victim bore| When keen with life to a dead horror bound?| Why take we up the accursed thing again?| Pity, forgive, but urge them back no more| Who, drunk with passion, flaunt disunion's rag| With its vile reptile blazon. Let us press| The golden cluster on our brave old flag| In closer union, and, if numbering less,| Brighter shall shine the stars which still remain.| 
The Old Guitar, by James Whitcomb Riley| 19th| Neglected now is the old guitar| And moldering into decay;| Fretted with many a rift and scar| That the dull dust hides away,| While the spider spins a silver star| In its silent lips to-day.| | The keys hold only nerveless strings--| The sinews of brave old airs| Are pulseless now; and the scarf that clings| So closely here declares| A sad regret in its ravelings| And the faded hue it wears.| | But the old guitar, with a lenient grace,| Has cherished a smile for me;| And its features hint of a fairer face| That comes with a memory| Of a flower-and-perfume-haunted place| And a moonlit balcony.| | Music sweeter than words confess,| Or the minstrel's powers invent,| Thrilled here once at the light caress| Of the fairy hands that lent| This excuse for the kiss I press| On the dear old instrument.| | The rose of pearl with the jeweled stem| Still blooms; and the tiny sets| In the circle all are here; the gem| In the keys, and the silver frets;| But the dainty fingers that danced o'er them--| Alas for the heart's regrets!--| | Alas for the loosened strings to-day,| And the wounds of rift and scar| On a worn old heart, with its roundelay| Enthralled with a stronger bar| That Fate weaves on, through a dull decay| Like that of the old guitar!| 
Silver Filigree, by Elinor Wylie| 19th| The icicles wreathing| On trees in festoon| Swing, swayed to our breathing:| They're made of the moon.| | She's a pale, waxen taper;| And these seem to drip| Transparent as paper| From the flame of her tip.| | Molten, smoking a little,| Into crystal they pass;| Falling, freezing, to brittle| And delicate glass.| | Each a sharp-pointed flower,| Each a brief stalactite| Which hangs for an hour| In the blue cave of night.|
