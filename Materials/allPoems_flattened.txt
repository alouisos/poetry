Riot Act, April 29, 1992, by Ai| Poet| I'm going out and get something.| I don't know what.| I don't care.| Whatever's out there, I'm going to get it.| Look in those shop windows at boxes| and boxes of Reeboks and Nikes| to make me fly through the air| like Michael Jordan| like Magic.| While I'm up there, I see Spike Lee.| Looks like he's flying too| straight through the glass| that separates me| from the virtual reality| I watch everyday on TV.| I know the difference between| what it is and what it isn't.| Just because I can't touch it| doesn't mean it isn't real.| All I have to do is smash the screen,| reach in and take what I want.| Break out of prison.| South Central homey's newly risen| from the night of living dead,| but this time he lives,| he gets to give the zombies| a taste of their own medicine.| Open wide and let me in,| or else I'll set your world on fire,| but you pretend that you don't hear.| You haven't heard the word is coming down| like the hammer of the gun| of this black son, locked out of this big house,| while massa looks out the window and sees only smoke.| Massa doesn't see anything else,| not because he can't,| but because he won't.| He'd rather hear me talking about mo' money,| mo' honeys and gold chains| and see me carrying my favorite things| from looted stores| than admit that underneath my Raider's cap,| the aftermath is staring back| unblinking through the camera's lens,| courtesy of CNN,| my arms loaded with boxes of shoes| that I will sell at the swap meet| to make a few cents on the declining dollar.| And if I destroy myself| and my neighborhood| ain't nobody's business, if I do,| but the police are knocking hard| at my door| and before I can open it,| they break it down| and drag me in the yard.| They take me in to be processed and charged,| to await trial,| while Americans forget| the day the wealth finally trickled down| to the rest of us.| 
Twenty-year Marriage, by Ai| Poet| You keep me waiting in a truck| with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch,| while you piss against the south side of a tree.| Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight.| That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows| and the seat, one fake leather thigh,| pressed close to mine is cold.| I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago,| but get inside me, start the engine;| you'll have the strength, the will to move.| I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half.| Come on, baby, lay me down on my back.| Pretend you don't owe me a thing| and maybe we'll roll out of here,| leaving the past stacked up behind us;| old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again.| 
To Dorothy, by Marvin Bell| Poet| You are not beautiful, exactly.| You are beautiful, inexactly.| You let a weed grow by the mulberry| And a mulberry grow by the house.| So close, in the personal quiet| Of a windy night, it brushes the wall| And sweeps away the day till we sleep.| | A child said it, and it seemed true:| "Things that are lost are all equal."| But it isn't true. If I lost you,| The air wouldn't move, nor the tree grow.| Someone would pull the weed, my flower.| The quiet wouldn't be yours. If I lost you,| I'd have to ask the grass to let me sleep.| 
To an Adolescent Weeping Willow, by Marvin Bell| Poet| I don't know what you think you're doing,| sweeping the ground. You| do it so easily, backhanded, forehanded.| You hardly bend. Really, you sway.| | What can it mean| when a thing is so easy?| | I threw dirt on my father's floor.| Not dirt, but a chopped green| dirt which picked up dirt.| | I pushed the push broom.| I oiled the wooden floor of the store.| | He bent over and lifted the coal| into the coal stove. With the back of the shovel| he came down on the rat just topping the bin| and into the fire.| | What do you think? - Did he sway?| Did he kiss a rock for luck?| Did he soak up water| and climb into light and turn and turn?| | Did he weep and weep in the yard?| | Yes, I think he did. Yes,| now I think he did.| | So, Willow, you come sweep my floor.| I have no store.| I have a yard. A big yard.| | I have a song to weep.| I have a cry.| | You who rose up from the dirt,| because I put you there| and like to walk my head in under| your earliest feathery branches-| what can it mean| when a thing is so easy?| | It means you are a boy.| 
Dream Song 26: The glories of the world struck me, by John Berryman| Poet| The glories of the world struck me, made me aria, once.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| if be you cares to say.| -Henry. Henry became interested in women's bodies,| his loins were & were the    scene of stupendous achievement.| Stupor. Knees, dear. Pray.| | All the knobs & softnesses of, my God,| the ducking & trouble it swarm on Henry,| at one time.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| you seems excited-like.| -Fell Henry back into    the original crime: art, rime| | besides a sense of others, my God, my God,| and a jealousy for the honour (alive) of his country,| what can get more odd?| and discontent with the thriving gangs & pride.| -What happen then, Mr Bones?| -I had a most marvellous    piece of luck. I died.| 
Dream Song 172: Your face broods, by John Berryman| Poet| Your face broods from my table, Suicide.| Your force came on like a torrent toward the end| of agony and wrath.| You were christened in the beginning Sylvia Plath| and changed that name for Mrs Hughes and bred| and went on round the bend| | till the oven seemed the proper place for you.| I brood upon your face, the geography of grief,| hooded, till I allow| again your resignation from us now| though the screams of orphaned children fix me anew.| Your torment here was brief,| | long falls your exit all repeatingly,| a poor exemplum, one more suicide,| to stack upon the others| till stricken Henry with his sisters & brothers| suddenly gone pauses to wonder why he| alone breasts the wronging tide.| 
The Fish, by Elizabeth Bishop| Poet| I caught a tremendous fish| and held him beside the boat| half out of water, with my hook| fast in a corner of his mouth.| He didn't fight.| He hadn't fought at all.| He hung a grunting weight,| battered and venerable| and homely. Here and there| his brown skin hung in strips| like ancient wallpaper,| and its pattern of darker brown| was like wallpaper:| shapes like full-blown roses| stained and lost through age.| He was speckled and barnacles,| fine rosettes of lime,| and infested| with tiny white sea-lice,| and underneath two or three| rags of green weed hung down.| While his gills were breathing in| the terrible oxygen| --the frightening gills,| fresh and crisp with blood,| that can cut so badly--| I thought of the coarse white flesh| packed in like feathers,| the big bones and the little bones,| the dramatic reds and blacks| of his shiny entrails,| and the pink swim-bladder| like a big peony.| I looked into his eyes| which were far larger than mine| but shallower, and yellowed,| the irises backed and packed| with tarnished tinfoil| seen through the lenses| of old scratched isinglass.| They shifted a little, but not| to return my stare.| --It was more like the tipping| of an object toward the light.| I admired his sullen face,| the mechanism of his jaw,| and then I saw| that from his lower lip| --if you could call it a lip| grim, wet, and weaponlike,| hung five old pieces of fish-line,| or four and a wire leader| with the swivel still attached,| with all their five big hooks| grown firmly in his mouth.| A green line, frayed at the end| where he broke it, two heavier lines,| and a fine black thread| still crimped from the strain and snap| when it broke and he got away.| Like medals with their ribbons| frayed and wavering,| a five-haired beard of wisdom| trailing from his aching jaw.| I stared and stared| and victory filled up| the little rented boat,| from the pool of bilge| where oil had spread a rainbow| around the rusted engine| to the bailer rusted orange,| the sun-cracked thwarts,| the oarlocks on their strings,| the gunnels--until everything| was rainbow, rainbow, rainbow!| And I let the fish go.| 
Warning to the Reader, by Robert Bly| Poet| Sometimes farm granaries become especially beautiful when all the oats or wheat are gone, and wind has swept the rough floor clean. Standing inside, we see around us, coming in through the cracks between shrunken wall boards, bands or strips of sunlight. So in a poem about imprisonment, one sees a little light.| But how many birds have died trapped in these granaries. The bird, seeing freedom in the light, flutters up the walls and falls back again and again. The way out is where the rats enter and leave; but the rat's hole is low to the floor. Writers, be careful then by showing the sunlight on the walls not to promise the anxious and panicky blackbirds a way out!| I say to the reader, beware. Readers who love poems of light may sit hunched in the corner with nothing in their gizzards for four days, light failing, the eyes glazed. They may end as a mound of feathers and a skull on the open boardwood floor. | 
The Russian, by Robert Bly| Poet| The Russians had few doctors on the front line.| My father's job was this: after the battle| Was over, he'd walk among the men hit,| Sit down and ask: 'Would you like to die on your| Own in a few hours, or should I finish it?'| Most said, 'Don't leave me.' The two would have| A cigarette. He'd take out his small notebook-| We had no dogtags, you know- and write the man's| Name down, his wife's, his children, his address, and what| He wanted to say. When the the cigarette was done,| The soldier would turn his head to the side. My father| Finished off four hundred men that way during the war.| He never went crazy. They were his people.| | He came to Toronto. My father in the summers| Would stand on the lawn with a hose, watering| The grass that way. It took a long time. He'd talk| To the moon, to the wind. 'I can hear you growing'-| He'd say to the grass. 'We come and go.| We're no different from each other. We are all| Part of something. We have a home.' When I was thirteen,| I said, 'Dad, do you know they've invented sprinklers| Now?' He went on watering the grass.| 'This is my life. Just shut up if you don't understand it.'| 
A Lovely Love, by Gwendolyn Brooks| Poet| Let it be alleys. Let it be a hall| Whose janitor javelins epithet and thought| To cheapen hyacinth darkness that we sought| And played we found, rot, make the petals fall.| Let it be stairways, and splintery box| Where you have thrown me, scraped me with your kiss,| Have honed me, have released me after this| Cavern kindness, smiled away our shocks.| This is the birthright of our lovely love.| In swaddling clothes. Not like that Other one.| Nor lit by any fondling star above.| Nor found by any wise men, either. Run.| People are coming. They must not catch us here| Definitionless in this strict atmosphere.| 
The Choir, by Olga Broumas| Poet| I walk and I rest while the eyes of my dead| look through my own, inaudible| hosannas greet| the panorama charged serene| and almost ultraviolet with so much witness.| Holy the sea, the palpitating membrane| divided into dazzling fields and whaledark by the sun.| 
at the cemetery, walnut grove plantation, south carolina, 1989, by Lucille Clifton| Poet| among the rocks| at walnut grove| your silence drumming| in my bones,| tell me your names.| | nobody mentioned slaves| and yet the curious tools| shine with your fingerprints.| nobody mentioned slaves| but somebody did this work| who had no guide, no stone,| who moulders under rock.| | tell me your names,| tell me your bashful names| and i will testify.| | the inventory lists ten slaves| but only men were recognized.| | among the rocks| at walnut grove| some of these honored dead| were dark| some of these dark| were slaves| some of these slaves| were women| some of them did this| honored work.| tell me your names| foremothers, brothers,| tell me your dishonored names.| here lies| here lies| here lies| here lies| hear| 
scar, by Lucille Clifton| Poet| we will learn| to live together.| | i will call you| ribbon of hunger| and desire| empty pocket flap| edge of before and after.| | and you| what will you call me?| | woman i ride| and who cannot throw me| | and i will not fall off.| 
Japan, by Billy Collins| Poet| Today I pass the time reading| a favorite haiku,| saying the few words over and over.| | It feels like eating| the same small, perfect grape| again and again.| | I walk through the house reciting it| and leave its letters falling| through the air of every room.| | I stand by the big silence of the piano and say it.| I say it in front of a painting of the sea.| I tap out its rhythm on an empty shelf.| | I listen to myself saying it,| then I say it without listening,| then I hear it without saying it.| | And when the dog looks up at me,| I kneel down on the floor| and whisper it into each of his long white ears.| | It's the one about the one-ton temple bell| with the moth sleeping on its surface,| | and every time I say it, I feel the excruciating| pressure of the moth| on the surface of the iron bell.| | When I say it at the window,| the bell is the world| and I am the moth resting there.| | When I say it at the mirror,| I am the heavy bell| and the moth is life with its papery wings.| | And later, when I say it to you in the dark,| you are the bell,| and I am the tongue of the bell, ringing you,| | and the moth has flown| from its line| and moves like a hinge in the air above our bed.| 
Writing in the Afterlife, by Billy Collins| Poet| I imagined the atmosphere would be clear,| shot with pristine light,| not this sulphurous haze,| the air ionized as before a thunderstorm.| | Many have pictured a river here,| but no one mentioned all the boats,| their benches crowded with naked passengers,| each bent over a writing tablet.| | I knew I would not always be a child| with a model train and a model tunnel,| and I knew I would not live forever,| jumping all day through the hoop of myself.| | I had heard about the journey to the other side| and the clink of the final coin| in the leather purse of the man holding the oar,| but how could anyone have guessed| | that as soon as we arrived| we would be asked to describe this place| and to include as much detail as possible-| not just the water, he insists,| | rather the oily, fathomless, rat-happy water,| not simply the shackles, but the rusty,| iron, ankle-shredding shackles-| and that our next assignment would be| | to jot down, off the tops of our heads,| our thoughts and feelings about being dead,| not really an assignment,| the man rotating the oar keeps telling us-| | think of it more as an exercise, he groans,| think of writing as a process,| a never-ending, infernal process,| and now the boats have become jammed together,| | bow against stern, stern locked to bow,| and not a thing is moving, only our diligent pens.| 
The Language, by Robert Creeley| Poet| Locate I| love you some-| where in| | teeth and| eyes, bite| it but| | take care not| to hurt, you| want so| | much so| little. Words| say everything.| | I| love you| again,| | then what| is emptiness| for. To| | fill, fill.| I heard words| and words full| | of holes| aching. Speech| is a mouth.| 
The Warning, by Robert Creeley| Poet| For love - I would| split open your head and put| a candle in| behind the eyes.| | Love is dead in us| if we forget| the virtues of an amulet| and quick surprise.| 
Adultery, by James Dickey| Poet| We have all been in rooms| We cannot die in, and they are odd places, and sad.| Often Indians are standing eagle-armed on hills| | In the sunrise open wide to the Great Spirit| Or gliding in canoes or cattle are browsing on the walls| Far away gazing down with the eyes of our children| | Not far away or there are men driving| The last railspike, which has turned| Gold in their hands. Gigantic forepleasure lives| | Among such scenes, and we are alone with it| At last. There is always some weeping| Between us and someone is always checking| | A wrist watch by the bed to see how much| Longer we have left. Nothing can come| Of this nothing can come| | Of us: of me with my grim techniques| Or you who have sealed your womb| With a ring of convulsive rubber:| | Although we come together,| Nothing will come of us. But we would not give| It up, for death is beaten| | By praying Indians by distant cows historical| Hammers by hazardous meetings that bridge| A continent. One could never die here| | Never die never die| While crying. My lover, my dear one| I will see you next week| | When I'm in town. I will call you| If I can. Please get hold of Please don't| Oh God, Please don't any more I can't bear.  Listen:| | We have done it again we are| Still living. Sit up and smile,| God bless you. Guilt is magical.| 
Tomatoes, by Stephen Dobyns| Poet| A woman travels to Brazil for plastic| surgery and a face-lift. She is sixty| and has the usual desire to stay pretty.| Once she is healed, she takes her new face| out on the streets of Rio. A young man| with a gun wants her money. Bang, she's dead.| The body is shipped back to New York,| but in the morgue there is a mix-up. The son| is sent for. He is told that his mother| is one of these ten different women.| Each has been shot. Such is modern life.| He studies them all but can't find her.| With her new face, she has become a stranger.| Maybe it's this one, maybe it's that one.| He looks at their breasts. Which ones nursed him?| He presses their hands to his cheek.| Which ones consoled him? He even tries| climbing onto their laps to see which| feels most familiar but the coroner stops him.| Well, says the coroner, which is your mother?| They all are, says the young man, let me| take them as a package. The coroner hesitates,| then agrees. Actually, it solved a lot of problems.| The young man has the ten women shipped home,| then cremates them all together. You've seen| how some people have a little urn on the mantel?| This man has a huge silver garbage can.| In the spring, he drags the garbage can| out to the garden and begins working the teeth,| the ash, the bits of bone into the soil.| Then he plants tomatoes. His mother loved tomatoes.| They grow straight from seed, so fast and big| that the young man is amazed. He takes the first| ten into the kitchen. In their roundness,| he sees his mother's breasts. In their smoothness| he finds the consoling touch of her hands.| Mother, mother, he cries, and flings himself| on the tomatoes. Forget about the knife, the fork,| the pinch of salt. Try to imagine the filial| starvation, think of his ravenous kisses.| 
Fragments, by Stephen Dobyns| Poet| Now there is a slit in the blue fabric of air.| His house spins faster. He holds down books,| chairs; his life and its objects fly upward:| vanishing black specks in the indifferent sky.| | The sky is a torn piece of blue paper.| He tries to repair it, but the memory| of death is like paste on his fingers| and certain days stick like dead flies.| | Say the sky goes back to being the sky| and the sun continues as always. Now,| knowing what you know, how can you not see| thin cracks in the fragile blue vaults of air.| | My friend, what can I give you or darkness| lift from you but fragments of language,| fragments of blue sky. You had three| beautiful daughters and one has died.| 
Wingfoot Lake, by Rita Dove| Poet| (Independence Day, 1964)| On her 36th birthday, Thomas had shown her| her first swimming pool. It had been| his favorite color, exactly-just| so much of it, the swimmers' white arms jutting| into the chevrons of high society.| She had rolled up her window| and told him to drive on, fast.| | Now this act of mercy: four daughters| dragging her to their husbands' company picnic,| white families on one side and them| on the other, unpacking the same| squeeze bottles of Heinz, the same| waxy beef patties and Salem potato chip bags.| So he was dead for the first time| on Fourth of July-ten years ago| | had been harder, waiting for something to happen,| and ten years before that, the girls| like young horses eyeing the track.| Last August she stood alone for hours| in front of the T.V. set| as a crow's wing moved slowly through| the white streets of government.| That brave swimming| | scared her, like Joanna saying| Mother, we're Afro-Americans now!| What did she know about Africa?| Were there lakes like this one| with a rowboat pushed under the pier?| Or Thomas' Great Mississippi| with its sullen silks? (There was| the Nile but the Nile belonged| | to God.) Where she came from| was the past, 12 miles into town| where nobody had locked their back door,| and Goodyear hadn't begun to dream of a park| under the company symbol, a white foot| sprouting two small wings.| 
The Stairway, by Stephen Dunn| Poet| The architect wanted to build a stairway| and suspend it with silver, almost invisible| guy wires in a high-ceilinged room,| a stairway you couldn't ascend or descend except in your dreams. But first -| because wild things are not easily seen| if what's around them is wild -| he'd make sure the house that housed it| was practical, built two-by-four by| two-by-four, slat by slat, without ornament.| The stairway would be an invitation| to anyone who felt invited by it,| and depending on your reaction he'd know| if friendship were possible.| The house he'd claim as his, but the stairway| would be designed to be ownerless,| tilted against any suggestion of a theology,| disappointing to those looking for politics.| Of course the architect knew| that over the years he'd have to build| other things the way others desired,| knew that to live in this world was to trade| a few industrious hours for one beautiful one.| Yet every night when he got home| he could imagine, as he walked in the door,| his stairway going nowhere, not for sale,| and maybe some you to whom nothing| about it need be explained, waiting,| the wine decanted, the night about to unfold.| 
The Strange People, by Louise Erdrich| Poet| The antelope are strange people .  they are beautiful to look at, and yet they are tricky. We do not trust them. They appear and disappear; they are like shadows on the plains. Because of their great beauty, young men sometimes follow the antelope and are lost forever. Even if those foolish ones find themselves and return, they are never again right in their heads.| -Pretty Shield,| Medicine Woman of the Crows| transcribed and edited by| Frank Linderman (1932)| All night I am the doe, breathing| his name in a frozen field,| the small mist of the word| drifting always before me.| | And again he has heard it| and I have gone burning| to meet him, the jacklight| fills my eyes with blue fire;| the heart in my chest| explodes like a hot stone.| | Then slung like a sack| in the back of his pickup,| I wipe the death scum| from my mouth, sit up laughing| and shriek in my speeding grave.| | Safely shut in the garage,| when he sharpens his knife| and thinks to have me, like that,| I come toward him,| a lean gray witch| through the bullets that enter and dissolve.| | I sit in his house| drinking coffee till dawn| and leave as frost reddens on hubcaps,| crawling back into my shadowy body.| All day, asleep in clean grasses,| I dream of the one who could really wound me.| Not with weapons, not with a kiss, not with a look.| Not even with his goodness.| | If a man was never to lie to me. Never lie me.| I swear I would never leave him.| 
New Vows, by Louise Erdrich| Poet| The night was clean as the bone of a rabbit blown hollow.| I cast my hood of dogskin| away, and my shirt of nettles.| Ten years had been enough. I left my darkened house.| | The trick was in living that death to its source.| When it happened, I wandered toward more than I was.| | Widowed by men, I married the dark firs,| As if I were walking in sleep toward their arms.| I drank, without fear or desire,| this odd fire.| | Now shadows move freely within me as words.| These are eternal, these stunned, loosened verbs.| And I can't tell you yet| how truly I belong| | to the hiss and shift of wind,| these slow, variable mouths| through which, at certain times, I speak in tongues.| 
Sexual Jealousy, by Carol Frost| Poet| Think of the queen mole who is unequivocal,| exuding a scent to keep the other females neuter| and bringing forth the colonly's only babies, hairless and pink in the| dark| of her tunneled chamber. She may chew a pale something, a root,| find it tasteless, drop it for the dreary others to take away, then| demand| more; she must suckle the young. Of course| they all hate her and are jealous of the attention given her| by her six bedmates. In their mutual dream she is dead and her urine| no longer arrests their maturing. As irises infallibly unfold,| one of their own will feel her sex grow quickest and greatest. As they| dig| together, their snouts full of soil, they hope this and are ruthless in| their waiting.| 
The Undressing, by Carol Frost| Poet| They took off their clothes 1000 nights| and felt the plaster of the moon| sift over them, and the ground roll| them in its dream. Little did they know| the light light and clay and their own sweat| became a skin they couldn't wash away.| Each night bonded to the next,| and they grew stiffer. They noticed this| in sunlight - there were calluses,| round tough moons on their extremities,| shadows under their eyes,| and sometimes a faint sour smell they hadn't had as children.| It worried them, but at night the animal| in their bodies overcame their reluctance| to be naked with each other,| and the mineral moon did its work.| At last when they woke up and were dead,| statues on their backs in the park,| they opened their mouths| and crawled out, pitifully soft and small,| not yet souls.| 
To Kill a Deer, by Carol Frost| Poet| Into the changes of autumn brush| the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears| were the tinsel browns. They made her.| I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples,| and I shot her. Into the pines she ran,| and I ran after. I might have lost her,| seeing no sign of blood or scuffle,| but felt myself part of the woods,| a woman with a doe's ears, and heard her| dying, counted her last breaths like a song| of dying, and found her dying.| I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets,| then poked her with the gun barrel| because her eyes were dusty and unreal.| I opened her belly and pushed the insides| like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole,| skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee,| took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell| that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes.| I left her refolded in some briars| with the last sun on her head| like a benediction, head tilted on its axis| of neck and barren bone; head bent| wordless over a death, though I heard| the night wind blowing through her fur,| heard riot in the emptied head.| 
Nostos, Louise Gluck| Poet| There was an apple tree in the yard --| this would have been| forty years ago -- behind,| only meadows. Drifts| of crocus in the damp grass.| I stood at that window:| late April. Spring| flowers in the neighbor's yard.| How many times, really, did the tree| flower on my birthday,| the exact day, not| before, not after? Substitution| of the immutable| for the shifting, the evolving.| Substitution of the image| for relentless earth. What| do I know of this place,| the role of the tree for decades| taken by a bonsai, voices| rising from the tennis courts --| Fields. Smell of the tall grass, new cut.| As one expects of a lyric poet.| We look at the world once, in childhood.| The rest is memory.| 
Celestial Music, by Louise Gluck| Poet| I have a friend who still believes in heaven.| Not a stupid person, yet with all she knows, she literally talks to God.| She thinks someone listens in heaven.| On earth she's unusually competent.| Brave too, able to face unpleasantness.| | We found a caterpillar dying in the dirt, greedy ants crawling over it.| I'm always moved by disaster, always eager to oppose vitality| But timid also, quick to shut my eyes.| Whereas my friend was able to watch, to let events play out| According to nature. For my sake she intervened| Brushing a few ants off the torn thing, and set it down| Across the road.| | My friend says I shut my eyes to God, that nothing else explains| My aversion to reality. She says I'm like the child who| Buries her head in the pillow| So as not to see, the child who tells herself| That light causes sadness-| My friend is like the mother. Patient, urging me| To wake up an adult like herself, a courageous person-| | In my dreams, my friend reproaches me. We're walking| On the same road, except it's winter now;| She's telling me that when you love the world you hear celestial music:| Look up, she says. When I look up, nothing.| Only clouds, snow, a white business in the trees| Like brides leaping to a great height-| Then I'm afraid for her; I see her| Caught in a net deliberately cast over the earth-| | In reality, we sit by the side of the road, watching the sun set;| From time to time, the silence pierced by a birdcall.| It's this moment we're trying to explain, the fact| That we're at ease with death, with solitude.| My friend draws a circle in the dirt; inside, the caterpillar doesn't move.| She's always trying to make something whole, something beautiful, an image| Capable of life apart from her.| We're very quiet. It's peaceful sitting here, not speaking, The composition| Fixed, the road turning suddenly dark, the air| Going cool, here and there the rocks shining and glittering-| It's this stillness we both love.| The love of form is a love of endings.| 
How Simile Works, by Albert Goldbarth| Poet| The drizzle-slicked cobblestone alleys| of some city;| and the brickwork back| of the lumbering Galapagos tortoise| they'd set me astride, at the "petting zoo". .| | The taste of our squabble still in my mouth| the next day;| and the brackish puddles sectioning| the street one morning after a storm. .| | So poetry configures its comparisons.| | My wife and I have been arguing; now| I'm telling her a childhood reminiscence,| stroking her back, her naked back that was| the particles in the heart of a star and will be| again, and is hers, and is like nothing| else, and is like the components of everything.| 
The Older Child, by Kimiko Hahn| Poet| What will become of her earliest memory --| the sperm whale battling the giant squid| in the dark exhibition at the museum?| looking up at 3 am| to see her sister pressed against two white breasts?| or maybe her yellow room| filled with the noise of boys in the vacant lot:| bang, boom-boom, fuckyoufuckyoufuck you.| 
The Porcelain Couple, by Donald Hall| Poet| When Jane felt well enough for me to leave her| for a whole day, I drove south by the river| to empty my mother Lucy's house in Connecticut.| I hurried from room to room, cellar to attic,| opening a crammed closet, then turning| to discover a chest with five full drawers.| I labelled for shipping sofas and chairs,| bedroom sets, and tables; I wrapped figurines| and fancy teacups in paper, preserving things| she cherished--and dreaded, in her last years,| might go for a nickel on the Spring Glen lawn.| Everywhere I looked I saw shelves and tabletops| covered with Lucy's glass animals and music boxes.| Everywhere in closets, decades of dresses hung| in dead air. I carried garbage bags in one hand,| and with the other swept my mother's leftover| possessions into sacks for the Hamden dump.| I stuffed bags full of blouses, handkerchiefs,| and the green-gold dress she wore to Bermuda.| At the last moment I discovered and saved| a cut-glass tumbler, stained red at the top,| Lucy 1905 scripted on the stain. In the garage| I piled the clanking bags, then drove four hours| north with my hands tight on the Honda's wheel,| drank a beer looking through Saturday's mail,| pitched into bed beside Jane fitfully asleep,| and woke exhausted from rolling unendable| nightmares of traffic and fire. In my dreams| I grieved or mourned interchangeably for Lucy,| for Lucy's things, for Jane, and for me.| When I woke, I rose as if from a drunken sleep| after looting a city and burning its temples.| All day as I ate lunch or counted out pills,| or as we lay weeping, hugging in bed together,| I counted precious things from our twenty years:| a blue vase, a candelabrum Jane carried on her lap| from the Baja, and the small porcelain box| from France I found under the tree one Christmas| where a couple in relief stretch out asleep,| like a catafalque, on the pastel double bed| of the box's top, both wearing pretty nightcaps.| 
Reuben, Reuben, by Michael S. Harper| Poet| I reach from pain| to music great enough| to bring me back,| swollenhead, madness,| lovefruit, a pickle of hate| so sour my mouth twicked| up and would not sing;| there's nothing in the beat| to hold it in| melody and turn human skin;| a brown berry gone| to rot just two days on the branch;| we've lost a son,| the music, jazz, comes in.| 
Our Lady of the Snows, by Robert Hass| Poet| In white,| the unpainted statue of the young girl| on the side altar| made the quality of mercy seem scrupulous and calm.| | When my mother was in a hospital drying out,| or drinking at a pace that would put her there soon,| I would slip in the side door,| light an aromatic candle,| and bargain for us both.| Or else I'd stare into the day-moon of that face| and, if I concentrated, fly.| | Come down! come down!| she'd call, because I was so high.| | Though mostly when I think of myself| at that age, I am standing at my older brother's closet| studying the shirts,| convinced that I could be absolutely transformed| by something I could borrow.| And the days churned by,| navigable sorrow.| 
The Image, by Robert Hass| Poet| The child brought blue clay from the creek| and the woman made two figures: a lady and a deer.| At that season deer came down from the mountain| and fed quietly in the redwood canyons.| The woman and the child regarded the figure of the lady,| the crude roundnesses, the grace, the coloring like shadow.| They were not sure where she came from,| except the child's fetching and the woman's hands| and the lead-blue clay of the creek| where the deer sometimes showed themselves at sundown.| 
Those Winter Sundays, by Robert Hayden| Poet| Sundays too my father got up early| And put his clothes on in the blueback cold,| then with cracked hands that ached| from labor in the weekday weather made| banked fires blaze. No one ever thanked him.| | I'd wake and hear the cold splintering, breaking.| When the rooms were warm, he'd call,| and slowly I would rise and dress,| fearing the chronic angers of that house,| | Speaking indifferently to him,| who had driven out the cold| and polished my good shoes as well.| What did I know, what did I know| of love's austere and lonely offices?| 
This Night, by William Heyen| Poet| Which is our star this night?| Belsen is bathed in blue,| every footworn lane, every| strand of wire, pale blue.| The guards' bodies,| the prisoners' bodies--all| black and invisible.  Only| their pale blue eyes| float above the lanes| or between the wires.| Or they are all dead,| and these are the blue eyes of those| haunted by what happened here.| Which eyes are yours,| which mine?  Even| blue-eyed crows| drift the darkness overhead.  Even| blue-eyed worms| sip dew from the weeping leaves| of the black Erika| over the graves. .| But now, at once, every| eye, every blue light| closes.  As we do.| For rest.  For now.| Which was our star this night?| 
Playing Dead, by Andrew Hudgins| Poet| Our father liked to play a game.| He played that he was dead.| He took his thick black glasses off| and stretched out on the bed.| | He wouldn't twitch and didn't snore| or move in any way.| He didn't even seem to breathe!| We asked, Are you okay?| | We tickled fingers up and down| his huge, pink, stinky feet-| He didn't move; he lay as still| as last year's parakeet.| | We pushed our fingers up his nose,| and wiggled them inside-| Next, we peeled his eyelids back.| Are you okay? we cried.| | I really thought he might be dead| and not just playing possum,| because his eyeballs didn't twitch| when I slid my tongue across 'em.| | He's dead, we sobbed-but to be sure,| I jabbed him in the jewels.| He rose, like Jesus, from the dead,| though I don't think Jesus drools.| | His right hand lashed both right and left.| His left hand clutched his scrotum.| And the words he yelled-I know damn well| I'm way too young to quote 'em.| 
Degrees Of Gray In Philipsburg, by Richard Hugo| Poet| You might come here Sunday on a whim.| Say your life broke down. The last good kiss| you had was years ago. You walk these streets| laid out by the insane, past hotels| that didn't last, bars that did, the tortured try| of local drivers to accelerate their lives.| Only churches are kept up. The jail| turned 70 this year. The only prisoner| is always in, not knowing what he's done.| | The principal supporting business now| is rage. Hatred of the various grays| the mountain sends, hatred of the mill,| The Silver Bill repeal, the best liked girls| who leave each year for Butte. One good| restaurant and bars can't wipe the boredom out.| The 1907 boom, eight going silver mines,| a dance floor built on springs--| all memory resolves itself in gaze,| in panoramic green you know the cattle eat| or two stacks high above the town,| two dead kilns, the huge mill in collapse| for fifty years that won't fall finally down.| | Isn't this your life? That ancient kiss| still burning out your eyes? Isn't this defeat| so accurate, the church bell simply seems| a pure announcement: ring and no one comes?| Don't empty houses ring? Are magnesium| and scorn sufficient to support a town,| not just Philipsburg, but towns| of towering blondes, good jazz and booze| the world will never let you have| until the town you came from dies inside?| | Say no to yourself. The old man, twenty| when the jail was built, still laughs| although his lips collapse. Someday soon,| he says, I'll go to sleep and not wake up.| You tell him no. You're talking to yourself.| The car that brought you here still runs.| The money you buy lunch with,| no matter where it's mined, is silver| and the girl who serves your food| is slender and her red hair lights the wall.| 
Absences, by Donald Justice| Poet| It's snowing this afternoon and there are no flowers.| There is only this sound of falling, quiet and remote,| Like the memory of scales descending the white keys| Of a childhood piano--outside the window, palms!| And the heavy head of the cereus, inclining,| Soon to let down its white or yellow-white.| | Now, only these poor snow-flowers in a heap,| Like the memory of a white dress cast down . . .| So much has fallen.| And I, who have listened for a step| All afternoon, hear it now, but already falling away,| Already in memory. And the terrible scales descending| On the silent piano; the snow; and the absent flowers abounding.| 
Variations On A Text By Vallejo, by Donald Justice| Poet| Me moriré en Paris con aguacero . | | I will die in Miami in the sun,| On a day when the sun is very bright,| A day like the days I remember, a day like other days,| A day that nobody knows or remembers yet,| And the sun will be bright then on the dark glasses of strangers| And in the eyes of a few friends from my childhood| And of the surviving cousins by the graveside,| While the diggers, standing apart, in the still shade of the palms,| Rest on their shovels, and smoke,| Speaking in Spanish softly, out of respect.| | | I think it will be on a Sunday like today,| Except that the sun will be out, the rain will have stopped,| And the wind that today made all the little shrubs kneel down;| And I think it will be a Sunday because today,| When I took out this paper and began to write,| Never before had anything looked so blank,| My life, these words, the paper, the gray Sunday;| And my dog, quivering under a table because of the storm,| Looked up at me, not understanding,| And my son read on without speaking, and my wife slept.| | | Donald Justice is dead. One Sunday the sun came out,| It shone on the bay, it shone on the white buildings,| The cars moved down the street slowly as always, so many,| Some with their headlights on in spite of the sun,| And after awhile the diggers with their shovels| Walked back to the graveside through the sunlight,| And one of them put his blade into the earth| To lift a few clods of dirt, the black marl of Miami,| And scattered the dirt, and spat,| Turning away abruptly, out of respect.| 
After Making Love we Hear Footsteps, by Galway Kinnell| Poet| For I can snore like a bullhorn| or play loud music| or sit up talking with any reasonably sober Irishman| and Fergus will only sink deeper| into his dreamless sleep, which goes by all in one flash,| but let there be that heavy breathing| or a stifled come-cry anywhere in the house| and he will wrench himself awake| and make for it on the run-as now, we lie together,| after making love, quiet, touching along the length of our bodies,| familiar touch of the long-married,| and he appears-in his baseball pajamas, it happens,| the neck opening so small he has to screw them on-| and flops down between us and hugs us and snuggles himself to sleep,| his face gleaming with satisfaction at being this very child.| | In the half darkness we look at each other| and smile| and touch arms across this little, startlingly muscled body-| this one whom habit of memory propels to the ground of his making,| sleeper only the mortal sounds can sing awake,| this blessing love gives again into our arms.| 
Blackberry Eating, by Galway Kinnell| Poet| I love to go out in late September| among the fat, overripe, icy, black blackberries| to eat blackberries for breakfast,| the stalks very prickly, a penalty| they earn for knowing the black art| of blackberry-making; and as I stand among them| lifting the stalks to my mouth, the ripest berries| fall almost unbidden to my tongue,| as words sometimes do, certain peculiar words| like strengths or squinched,| many-lettered, one-syllabled lumps,| which I squeeze, squinch open, and splurge well| in the silent, startled, icy, black language| of blackberry -- eating in late September.| 
Thrall, by Carolyn Kizer| Poet| The room is sparsely furnished:| A chair, a table, and a father.| | He sits in the chair by the window.| There are books on the table.| The time is always just past lunch.| | You tiptoe past as he eats his apple| And reads. He looks up, angry.| He has heard your asthmatic breathing.| | He will read for years without looking up| Until your childhood is safely over:| | Smells, untidiness, and boring questions;| Blood from the first skinned knees| To the first stained thighs;| The foolish tears of adolescent love.| | One day he looks up, pleased| At the finished product,| Now he is ready to love you!| | So he coaxes you in the voice reserved| For reading Keats. You agree to everything.| | Drilled in silence and duty,| You will give him no cause for reproach.| He will boast of you to strangers.| | When the afternoon is older| Shadows in a small room| Fall on he bed, the books, the father.| | You read aloud to him| "La Belle Dame sans Merci."| You feed him his medicine.| You tell him you love him.| | You wait for his eyes to close at last| So you may write this poem.| 
The Intruder, by Carolyn Kizer| Poet| My mother-preferring the strange to the tame:| Dove-note, bone marrow, deer dung,| Frog's belly distended with finny young,| Leaf-mold wilderness, harebell, toadstool,| Odd, small snakes roving through the leaves,| Metallic beetles rambling over stones: all| Wild and natural!-flashed out her instinctive love, and quick, she| Picked up the fluttering, bleeding bat the cat laid at her feet,| And held the little horror to the mirror, where| He gazed on himself, and shrieked like an old screen door far off.| | Depended from her pinched thumb, each wing| Came clattering down like a small black shutter.| Still tranquil, she began, "It's rather sweet . "| The soft mouse body, the hard feral glint| In the caught eyes. Then we saw,| And recoiled: lice, pallid, yellow,| Nested within the wing-pits, cozily sucked and snoozed.| The thing dropped from her hands, and with its thud,| Swiftly, the cat, with a clean careful mouth| Closed on the soiled webs, growling, took them out to the back stoop.| | But still, dark blood, a sticky puddle on the floor| Remained, of all my mother's tender, wounding passion| For a whole wild, lost, betrayed, and secret life| Among its dens and burrows, its clean stones,| Whose denizens can turn upon the world| With spitting tongue, an odor, talon, claw,| To sting or soil benevolence, alien| As our clumsy traps, our random scatter of shot.| She swept to the kitchen. Turning on the tap,| She washed and washed the pity from her hands.| 
Facing It, by Yusef Komunyakaa| Poet| My black face fades,| hiding inside the black granite.| I said I wouldn't,| dammit: No tears.| I'm stone. I'm flesh.| My clouded reflection eyes me| like a bird of prey, the profile of night| slanted against morning. I turn| this way--the stone lets me go.| I turn that way--I'm inside| the Vietnam Veterans Memorial| again, depending on the light| to make a difference.| I go down the 58,022 names,| half-expecting to find| my own in letters like smoke.| I touch the name Andrew Johnson;| I see the booby trap's white flash.| Names shimmer on a woman's blouse| but when she walks away| the names stay on the wall.| Brushstrokes flash, a red bird's| wings cutting across my stare.| The sky. A plane in the sky.| A white vet's image floats| closer to me, then his pale eyes| look through mine. I'm a window.| He's lost his right arm| inside the stone. In the black mirror| a woman's trying to erase names:| No, she's brushing a boy's hair.| 
Audacity of the Lower Gods, by Yusef Komunyakaa| Poet| I know salt marshes that move along like one big| trembling wing. I've noticed insects| shiny as gold in a blues singer's teeth| & more keenly calibrated than a railroad watch,| but at heart I'm another breed.| | The audacity of the lower gods-| whatever we name we own.| Diversiloba, we say, unfolding poison oak.| Lovers go untouched as we lean from bay windows| with telescopes trained on a yellow sky.| | I'd rather let the flowers| keep doing what they do best.| Unblessing each petal,| letting go a year's worth of white| death notes, busily unnaming themselves.| 
Heaven as Anus, by Maxine Kumin| Poet| In the Defense Department there is a shop| where scientists sew the eyelids of rabbits open| lest they blink in the scorch of a nuclear drop| | and elsewhere dolphins are being taught to defuse| bombs in the mock-up of a harbor and monkeys| learn to perform the simple tasks of draftees.| | It is done with electric shocks. Some mice| who have failed their time tests in the maze| now go to the wire unbidden for their jolts.| | Implanting electrodes yields rich results:| alley cats turn from predators into prey.| Show them a sparrow and they cower| | while the whitewall labs fill up with the feces of fear| where calves whose hearts have been done away| with walk and bleat on plastic pumps.| | And what is any of this to the godhead,| these squeals, whines, writhings, unexpected jumps,| whose children burn alive, booby-trap the dead,| lop ears and testicles, core and disembowel?| | It all ends at the hole. No words may enter| the house of excrement. We will meet there| as the sphincter of the good Lord opens wide| and He takes us all inside.| 
Nurture, by Maxine Kumin| Poet| From a documentary on marsupials I learn| that a pillowcase makes a fine| substitute pouch for an orphaned kangaroo.| | I am drawn to such dramas of animal rescue.| They are warm in the throat. I suffer, the critic proclaims,| from an overabundance of maternal genes.| | Bring me your fallen fledgling, your bummer lamb,| lead the abused, the starvelings, into my barn.| Advise the hunted deer to leap into my corn.| | And had there been a wild child -| filthy and fierce as a ferret, he is called| in one nineteenth-century account -| | a wild child to love, it is safe to assume,| given my fireside inked with paw prints,| there would have been room.| | Think of the language we two, same and not-same| might have constructed from sign,| scratch, grimace, grunt, vowel:| | Laughter our first noun, and our long verb. howl.| 
The Abduction, by Stanley Kunitz| Poet| Some things I do not profess| to understand, perhaps| not wanting to, including| whatever it was they did| with you or you with them| that timeless summer day| when you stumbled out of the wood,| distracted, with your white blouse torn| and a bloodstain on your skirt.| "Do you believe?" you asked.| Between us, through the years,| we pieced enough together| to make the story real:| how you encountered on the path| a pack of sleek, grey hounds,| trailed by a dumbshow retinue| in leather shrouds; and how| you were led, through leafy ways,| into the presence of a royal stag,| flaming in his chestnut coat,| who kneeled on a swale of moss| before you; and how you were borne| aloft in triumph through the green,| stretched on his rack of budding horn,| till suddenly you found yourself alone| in a trampled clearing.| | That was a long time ago,| almost another age, but even now,| when I hold you in my arms,| I wonder where you are.| Sometimes I wake to hear| the engines of the night thrumming| outside the east bay window| on the lawn spreading to the rose garden.| You lie beside me in elegant repose,| a hint of transport hovering on your lips,| indifferent to the harsh green flares| that swivel through the room,| searchlights controlled by unseen hands.| Out there is a childhood country,| bleached faces peering in| with coals for eyes.| Our lives are spinning out| from world to world;| the shapes of things| are shifting in the wind.| What do we know| beyond the rapture and the dread?| 
My Indigo, by Li-Young Lee| Poet| It's late. I've come| to find the flower which blossoms| like a saint dying upside down.| The rose won't do, nor the iris.| I've come to find the moody one, the shy one,| downcast, grave, and isolated.| Now, blackness gathers in the grass,| and I am on my hands and knees.| What is its name?| | Little sister, my indigo,| my secret, vaginal and sweet,| you unfurl yourself shamelessly| toward the ground. You burn. You live| a while in two worlds| at once.| 
Eating Alone, by Li-Young Lee| Poet| I've pulled the last of the year's young onions.| The garden is bare now. The ground is cold,| brown and old. What is left of the day flames| in the maples at the corner of my| eye. I turn, a cardinal vanishes.| By the cellar door, I wash the onions,| then drink from the icy metal spigot.| | Once, years back, I walked beside my father| among the windfall pears. I can't recall| our words. We may have strolled in silence. But| I still see him bend that way-left hand braced| on knee, creaky-to lift and hold to my| eye a rotten pear. In it, a hornet| spun crazily, glazed in slow, glistening juice.| | It was my father I saw this morning| waving to me from the trees. I almost| called to him, until I came close enough| to see the shovel, leaning where I had| left it, in the flickering, deep green shade.| | White rice steaming, almost done. Sweet green peas| fried in onions. Shrimp braised in sesame| oil and garlic. And my own loneliness.| What more could I, a young man, want.| 
The Mutes, by Denise Levertov| Poet| Those groans men use| passing a woman on the street| or on the steps of the subway| | to tell her she is a female| and their flesh knows it,| | are they a sort of tune,| an ugly enough song, sung| by a bird with a slit tongue| | but meant for music?| | Or are they the muffled roaring| of deafmutes trapped in a building that is| slowly filling with smoke?| | Perhaps both.| | Such men most often| look as if groan were all they could do,| yet a woman, in spite of herself,| | knows it's a tribute:| if she were lacking all grace| they'd pass her in silence:| | so it's not only to say she's| a warm hole. It's a word| | in grief-language, nothing to do with| primitive, not an ur-language;| language stricken, sickened, cast down| | in decrepitude. She wants to| throw the tribute away, dis-| gusted, and can't,| | it goes on buzzing in her ear,| it changes the pace of her walk,| the torn posters in echoing corridors| | spell it out, it| quakes and gnashes as the train comes in.| Her pulse sullenly| | had picked up speed,| but the cars slow down and| jar to a stop while her understanding| | keeps on translating:| 'Life after life after life goes by| | without poetry,| without seemliness,| without love.'| 
Wedding-Ring, by Denise Levertov| Poet| My wedding-ring lies in a basket| as if at the bottom of a well.| Nothing will come to fish it back up| and onto my finger again.| It lies| among keys to abandoned houses,| nails waiting to be needed and hammered| into some wall,| telephone numbers with no names attached,| idle paperclips.| It can't be given away| for fear of bringing ill-luck.| It can't be sold| for the marriage was good in its own| time, though that time is gone.| Could some artificer| beat into it bright stones, transform it| into a dazzling circlet no one could take| for solemn betrothal or to make promises| living will not let them keep? Change it| into a simple gift I could give in friendship?| 
They Feed They Lion, by Philip Levine| Poet| Out of burlap sacks, out of bearing butter,| Out of black bean and wet slate bread,| Out of the acids of rage, the candor of tar,| Out of creosote, gasoline, drive shafts, wooden dollies,| They Lion grow.| | Out of the gray hills| Of industrial barns, out of rain, out of bus ride,| West Virginia to Kiss My Ass, out of buried aunties,| Mothers hardening like pounded stumps, out of stumps,| Out of the bones' need to sharpen and the muscles' to stretch,| They Lion grow.| | Earth is eating trees, fence posts,| Gutted cars, earth is calling in her little ones,| "Come home, Come home!" From pig balls,| From the ferocity of pig driven to holiness,| From the furred ear and the full jowl come| The repose of the hung belly, from the purpose| They Lion grow.| | From the sweet glues of the trotters| Come the sweet kinks of the fist, from the full flower| Of the hams the thorax of caves,| From "Bow Down" come "Rise Up,"| Come they Lion from the reeds of shovels,| The grained arm that pulls the hands,| They Lion grow.| | From my five arms and all my hands,| From all my white sins forgiven, they feed,| From my car passing under the stars,| They Lion, from my children inherit,| From the oak turned to a wall, they Lion,| From they sack and they belly opened| And all that was hidden burning on the oil-stained earth| They feed they Lion and he comes.| 
Animals Are Passing From Our Lives, by Philip Levine| Poet| Listen| It's wonderful how I jog| on four honed-down ivory toes| my massive buttocks slipping| like oiled parts with each light step.| | I'm to market. I can smell| the sour, grooved block, I can smell| the blade that opens the hole| and the pudgy white fingers| | that shake out the intestines| like a hankie. In my dreams| the snouts drool on the marble,| suffering children, suffering flies,| | suffering the consumers| who won't meet their steady eyes| for fear they could see. The boy| who drives me along believes| | that any moment I'll fall| on my side and drum my toes| like a typewriter or squeal| and shit like a new housewife| | discovering television,| or that I'll turn like a beast| cleverly to hook his teeth| with my teeth. No. Not this pig.| 
"To Speak of Woe That Is in Marriage", by Robert Lowell| Poet| "The hot night makes us keep our bedroom windows open.| Our magnolia blossoms. Life begins to happen.| My hopped up husband drops his home disputes,| and hits the streets to cruise for prostitutes,| free-lancing out along the razor's edge.| This screwball might kill his wife, then take the pledge.| Oh the monotonous meanness of his lust. | It's the injustice. he is so unjust--| whiskey-blind, swaggering home at five.| My only thought is how to keep alive.| What makes him tick?Each night now I tie| ten dollars and his car key to my thigh. | Gored by the climacteric of his want,| he stalls above me like an elephant| 
Onions, by William Matthews| Poet| How easily happiness begins by| dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter| slithers and swirls across the floor| of the sauté pan, especially if its| errant path crosses a tiny slick| of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions.| | This could mean soup or risotto| or chutney (from the Sanskrit| chatni, to lick). Slowly the onions| go limp and then nacreous| and then what cookbooks call clear,| though if they were eyes you could see| | clearly the cataracts in them.| It's true it can make you weep| to peel them, to unfurl and to tease| from the taut ball first the brittle,| caramel-colored and decrepit| papery outside layer, the least| | recent the reticent onion| wrapped around its growing body,| for there's nothing to an onion| but skin, and it's true you can go on| weeping as you go on in, through| the moist middle skins, the sweetest| | and thickest, and you can go on| in to the core, to the bud-like,| acrid, fibrous skins densely| clustered there, stalky and in-| complete, and these are the most| pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare| | and rage and murmury animal| comfort that infant humans secrete.| This is the best domestic perfume.| You sit down to eat with a rumor| of onions still on your twice-washed| hands and lift to your mouth a hint| | of a story about loam and usual| endurance. It's there when you clean up| and rinse the wine glasses and make| a joke, and you leave the minutest| whiff of it on the light switch,| later, when you climb the stairs.| 
Charles on Fire, by James Merrill| Poet| Another evening we sprawled about discussing| Appearances. And it was the consensus| That while uncommon physical good looks| Continued to launch one, as before, in life| (Among its vaporous eddies and false claims),| Still, as one of us said into his beard,| "Without your intellectual and spiritual| Values, man, you are sunk." No one but squared| The shoulders of their own unlovliness.| Long-suffering Charles, having cooked and served the meal,| Now brought out little tumblers finely etched| He filled with amber liquor and then passed.| "Say," said the same young man, "in Paris, France,| They do it this way"--bounding to his feet| And touching a lit match to our host's full glass.| A blue flame, gentle, beautiful, came, went| Above the surface. In a hush that fell| We heard the vessel crack. The contents drained| As who should step down from a crystal coach.| Steward of spirits, Charles's glistening hand| All at once gloved itself in eeriness.| The moment passed. He made two quick sweeps and| Was flesh again. "It couldn't matter less,"| He said, but with a shocked, unconscious glance| Into the mirror. Finding nothing changed,| He filled a fresh glass and sank down among us.| 
b o d y, by James Merrill| Poet| Look closely at the letters. Can you see,| entering (stage right), then floating full,| then heading off-so soon-| how like a little kohl-rimmed moon| o plots her course from b to d| | -as y, unanswered, knocks at the stage door?| Looked at too long, words fail,| phase out. Ask, now that body shines| no longer, by what light you learn these lines| and what the b and d stood for.| 
For the Anniversary of My Death, by W.S. Merwin| Poet| Every year without knowing it I have passed the day| When the last fires will wave to me| And the silence will set out| Tireless traveller| Like the beam of a lightless star| Then I will no longer| Find myself in life as in a strange garment| Surprised at the earth| And the love of one woman| And the shamelessness of men| As today writing after three days of rain| Hearing the wren sing and the falling cease| And bowing not knowing to what| 
When You Go Away, by W.S. Merwin| Poet| When you go away the wind clicks around to the north| The painters work all day but at sundown the paint falls| Showing the black walls| The clock goes back to striking the same hour| That has no place in the years| | And at night wrapped in the bed of ashes| In one breath I wake| It is the time when the beards of the dead get their growth| I remember that I am falling| That I am the reason| And that my words are the garment of what I shall never be| Like the tucked sleeve of a one-armed boy| 
Minor Miracle, by Marilyn Nelson| Poet| Which reminds me of another knock-on-wood| memory. I was cycling with a male friend,| through a small midwestern town. We came to a 4-way| stop and stopped, chatting. As we started again,| a rusty old pick-up truck, ignoring the stop sign,| hurricaned past scant inches from our front wheels.| My partner called, "Hey, that was a 4-way stop!"| The truck driver, stringy blond hair a long fringe| under his brand-name beer cap, looked back and yelled,| "You fucking niggers!"| And sped off.| My friend and I looked at each other and shook our heads.| We remounted our bikes and headed out of town.| We were pedaling through a clear blue afternoon| between two fields of almost-ripened wheat| bordered by cornflowers and Queen Anne's lace| when we heard an unmuffled motor, a honk-honking.| We stopped, closed ranks, made fists.| It was the same truck. It pulled over.| A tall, very much in shape young white guy slid out:| greasy jeans, homemade finger tattoos, probably| a Marine Corps boot-camp footlockerful| of martial arts techniques.| | "What did you say back there!" he shouted.| My friend said, "I said it was a 4-way stop.| You went through it."| "And what did I say?" the white guy asked.| "You said: 'You fucking niggers.'"| The afternoon froze.| | "Well," said the white guy,| shoving his hands into his pockets| and pushing dirt around with the pointed toe of his boot,| "I just want to say I'm sorry."| He climbed back into his truck| and drove away.| 
The Small Vases from Hebron, by Naomi Shihab Nye| Poet| Tip their mouths open to the sky.| Turquoise, amber,| the deep green with fluted handle,| pitcher the size of two thumbs,| tiny lip and graceful waist.| | Here we place the smallest flower| which could have lived invisibly| in loose soil beside the road,| sprig of succulent rosemary,| bowing mint.| | They grow deeper in the center of the table.| | Here we entrust the small life,| thread, fragment, breath.| And it bends. It waits all day.| As the bread cools and the children| open their gray copybooks| to shape the letter that looks like| a chimney rising out of a house.| | And what do the headlines say?| | Nothing of the smaller petal| perfectly arranged inside the larger petal| or the way tinted glass filters light.| Men and boys, praying when they died,| fall out of their skins.| The whole alphabet of living,| heads and tails of words,| sentences, the way they said,| "Ya'Allah!" when astonished,| or "ya'ani" for "I mean"-| a crushed glass under the feet| still shines.| But the child of Hebron sleeps| with the thud of her brothers falling| and the long sorrow of the color red.| 
Hello, by Naomi Shihab Nye| Poet| Some nights| the rat with pointed teeth| makes his long way back| to the bowl of peaches.| He stands on the dining room table| sinking his tooth| drinking the pulp| of each fruity turned-up face| knowing you will read| this message and scream.| It is his only text,| to take and take in darkness,| to be gone before you awaken| and your giant feet| start creaking the floor.| | Where is the mother of the rat?| The father, the shredded nest,| which breath were we taking| when the rat was born,| when he lifted his shivering snout| to rafter and rivet and stone?| I gave him the names of the devil,| seared and screeching names,| I would not enter those rooms| without a stick to guide me,| I leaned on the light, shuddering,| and the moist earth under the house,| the trailing tails of clouds,| said he was in the closet,| the drawer of candles,| his nose was a wick.| | How would we live together| with our sad shoes and hideouts,| our lock on the door| and his delicate fingered paws| that could clutch and grip,| his blank slate of fur| and the pillow where we press our faces?| The bed that was a boat is sinking.| And the shores of morning loom up| lined with little shadows,| things we never wanted to be, or meet,| and all the rats are waving hello.| 
Personal Poem, by Frank O'Hara| Poet| Now when I walk around at lunchtime| I have only two charms in my pocket| an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me| and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case| when I was in Madrid the others never| brought me too much luck though they did| help keep me in New York against coercion| but now I'm happy for a time and interested| | I walk through the luminous humidity| passing the House of Seagram with its wet| and its loungers and the construction to| the left that closed the sidewalk if| I ever get to be a construction worker| I'd like to have a silver hat please| and get to Moriarty's where I wait for| LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and| shaker the last five years my batting average| is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in| and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12| times last night outside BIRDLAND by a cop| a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible| disease but we don't give her one we| don't like terrible diseases, then| we go eat some fish and some ale it's| cool but crowded we don't like Lionel Trilling| we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like| Henry James so much we like Herman Melville| we don't want to be in the poets' walk in| San Francisco even we just want to be rich| and walk on girders in our silver hats| I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is| thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi| and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go| back to work happy at the thought possibly so| 
Why I Am Not A Painter, by Frank O'Hara| Poet| I am not a painter, I am a poet.| Why? I think I would rather be| a painter, but I am not. Well,| | for instance, Mike Goldberg| is starting a painting. I drop in.| "Sit down and have a drink" he| says. I drink; we drink. I look| up. "You have SARDINES in it."| "Yes, it needed something there."| "Oh." I go and the days go by| and I drop in again. The painting| is going on, and I go, and the days| go by. I drop in. The painting is| finished. "Where's SARDINES?"| All that's left is just| letters, "It was too much," Mike says.| | But me? One day I am thinking of| a color: orange. I write a line| about orange. Pretty soon it is a| whole page of words, not lines.| Then another page. There should be| so much more, not of orange, of| words, of how terrible orange is| and life. Days go by. It is even in| prose, I am a real poet. My poem| is finished and I haven't mentioned| orange yet. It's twelve poems, I call| it ORANGES. And one day in a gallery| I see Mike's painting, called SARDINES.| 
May 1968, by Sharon Olds| Poet| When the Dean said we could not cross campus| until the students gave up the buildings,| we lay down, in the street,| we said the cops will enter this gate| over us. Lying back on the cobbles,| I saw the buildings of New York City| from dirt level, they soared up| and stopped, chopped off--above them, the sky,| the night air over the island.| The mounted police moved, near us,| while we sang, and then I began to count,| 12, 13, 14, 15,| I counted again, 15, 16, one| month since the day on that deserted beach,| 17, 18, my mouth fell open,| my hair on the street,| if my period did not come tonight| I was pregnant. I could see the sole of a cop's| shoe, the gelding's belly, its genitals--| if they took me to Women's Detention and did| the exam on me, the speculum,| the fingers--I gazed into the horse's tail| like a comet-train. All week, I had| thought about getting arrested, half-longed| to give myself away. On the tar--| one brain in my head, another,| in the making, near the base of my tail--| I looked at the steel arc of the horse's| shoe, the curve of its belly, the cop's| nightstick, the buildings streaming up| away from the earth. I knew I should get up| and leave, but I lay there looking at the space| above us, until it turned deep blue and then| ashy, colorless, Give me this one| night, I thought, and I'll give this child| the rest of my life, the horse's heads,| this time, drooping, dipping, until| they slept in a circle around my body and my daughter| 
University Hospital, Boston, by Mary Oliver| Poet| The trees on the hospital lawn| are lush and thriving. They too| are getting the best of care,| like you, and the anonymous many,| in the clean rooms high above this city,| where day and night the doctors keep| arriving, where intricate machines| chart with cool devotion| the murmur of the blood,| the slow patching-up of bone,| the despair of the mind.| | When I come to visit and we walk out| into the light of a summer day,| we sit under the trees -| buckeyes, a sycamore, and one| black walnut brooding| high over a hedge of lilacs| as old as the red-brick building| behind them, the original| hospital built before the Civil War.| We sit on the lawn together, holding hands| while you tell me: you are better.| | How many young men, I wonder,| came here, wheeled on cots off the slow trains| from the red and hideous battlefields| to lie all summer in the small and stuffy chambers| while doctors did what they could, longing| for tools still unimagined, medicines still unfound,| wisdoms still unguessed at, and how many died| staring at the leaves of the trees, blind| to the terrible effort around them to keep them alive?| I look into your eyes| | which are sometimes green and sometimes gray,| and sometimes full of humor, but often not,| and tell myself, you are better,| because my life without you would be| a place of parched and broken trees.| Later walking the corridors down to the street,| I turn and step inside an empty rom.| Yesterday someone was here with a gasping face.| Now the bed is made all new,| the machines have been rolled away. The silence| continues, deep and neutral,| as I stand there, loving you.| 
The Summer Day, by Mary Oliver| Poet| Who made the world?| Who made the swan, and the black bear?| Who made the grasshopper?| This grasshopper, I mean--| the one who has flung herself out of the grass,| the one who is eating sugar out of my hand,| who is moving her jaws back and forth instead of up and down--| who is gazing around with her enormous and complicated eyes.| Now she lifts her pale forearms and thoroughly washes her face.| Now she snaps her wings open, and floats away.| I don't know exactly what a prayer is.| I do know how to pay attention, how to fall down| into the grass, how to kneel in the grass,| how to be idle and blessed, how to stroll through the fields,| which is what I have been doing all day.| Tell me, what else should I have done?| Doesn't everything die at last, and too soon?| Tell me, what is is you plan to do| With your one wild and precious life?| 
Dearest Reader, by Michael Palmer| Poet| He painted the mountain over and over again| from his place in the cave, agape| at the light, its absence, the mantled| skull with blue-tinted hollows, wren-| like bird plucking berries from the fire| her hair alight and so on| lemon grass in cafe in clear glass.| Dearest reader there were trees| formed of wire, broad entryways| beneath balconies beneath spires| youthful head come to rest in meadow| beside bend in gravel road, still| body of milky liquid| her hair alight and so on| successive halls, flowered carpets and doors| or the photograph of nothing but pigeons| and grackles by the shadow of a fountain.| 
Aubade: Some Peaches, After Storm, by Carl Phillips| Poet| So that each| is its own, now--each has fallen, blond stillness.| Closer, above them,| the damselflies pass as they would over water,| if the fruit were water,| or as bees would, if they weren't| somewhere else, had the fruit found| already a point more steep| in rot, as soon it must, if| none shall lift it from the grass whose damp only| softens further those parts where flesh| goes soft.| | There are those| whom no amount of patience looks likely| to improve ever, I always said, meaning| gift is random,| assigned here,| here withheld--almost always| correctly| as it's turned out: how your hands clear| easily the wreckage;| how you stand--like a building for a time condemned,| then deemed historic. Yes. You| will be saved.| 
Crossing The Water, Sylvia Plath| Poet| Black lake, black boat, two black, cut-paper people.| Where do the black trees go that drink here?| Their shadows must cover Canada.| | A little light is filtering from the water flowers.| Their leaves do not wish us to hurry:| They are round and flat and full of dark advice.| | Cold worlds shake from the oar.| The spirit of blackness is in us, it is in the fishes.| A snag is lifting a valedictory, pale hand;| | Stars open among the lilies.| Are you not blinded by such expressionless sirens?| This is the silence of astounded souls.| 
Power, by Adrienne Rich| Poet| Living in the earth-deposits of our history| | Today a backhoe divulged out of a crumbling flank of earth| one bottle amber perfect a hundred-year-old| cure for fever or melancholy a tonic| for living on this earth in the winters of this climate.| | Today I was reading about Marie Curie:| she must have known she suffered from radiation sickness| her body bombarded for years by the element| she had purified| It seems she denied to the end| the source of the cataracts on her eyes| the cracked and suppurating skin of her finger-ends| till she could no longer hold a test-tube or a pencil| | She died a famous woman denying| her wounds| denying| her wounds came from the same source as her power.| 
Root Cellar, by Theodore Roethke| Poet| Nothing would sleep in that cellar, dank as a ditch,| Bulbs broke out of boxes hunting for chinks in the dark,| Shoots dangled and drooped,| Lolling obscenely from mildewed crates,| Hung down long yellow evil necks, like tropical snakes.| And what a congress of stinks!| Roots ripe as old bait,| Pulpy stems, rank, silo-rich,| Leaf-mold, manure, lime, piled against slippery planks.| Nothing would give up life:| Even the dirt kept breathing a small breath.| 
The Room of My Life, by Anne Sexton| Poet| Here,| in the room of my life| the objects keep changing.| Ashtrays to cry into,| the suffering brother of the wood walls,| the forty-eight keys of the typewriter| each an eyeball that is never shut,| the books, each a contestant in a beauty contest,| the black chair, a dog coffin made of Naugahyde,| the sockets on the wall| waiting like a cave of bees,| the gold rug| a conversation of heels and toes,| the fireplace| a knife waiting for someone to pick it up,| the sofa, exhausted with the exertion of a whore,| the phone| two flowers taking root in its crotch,| the doors| opening and closing like sea clams,| the lights| poking at me,| lighting up both the soil and the laugh.| The windows,| the starving windows| that drive the trees like nails into my heart.| Each day I feed the world out there| although birds explode| right and left.| I feed the world in here too,| offering the desk puppy biscuits.| However, nothing is just what it seems to be.| My objects dream and wear new costumes,| compelled to, it seems, by all the words in my hands| and the sea that bangs in my throat.| 
Her Kind, by Anne Sexton| Poet| I have gone out, a possessed witch,| haunting the black air, braver at night;| dreaming evil, I have done my hitch| over the plain houses, light by light:| lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.| A woman like that is not a woman, quite.| I have been her kind.| | I have found the warm caves in the woods,| filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,| closets, silks, innumerable goods;| fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:| whining, rearranging the disaligned.| A woman like that is misunderstood.| I have been her kind.| | I have ridden in your cart, driver,| waved my nude arms at villages going by,| learning the last bright routes, survivor| where your flames still bite my thigh| and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.| A woman like that is not ashamed to die.| I have been her kind.| 
Fork, by Charles Simic| Poet| This strange thing must have crept| Right out of hell.| It resembles a bird's foot| Worn around the cannibal's neck.| | As you hold it in your hand,| As you stab with it into a piece of meat,| It is possible to imagine the rest of the bird:| Its head which like your fist| Is large, bald, beakless, and blind.| 
My Noiseless Entourage, by Charles Simic| Poet| We were never formally introduced.| I had no idea who among them was really I?| It was like a discreet entourage.| Each one about the same height.| Variously dressed we took the subway| Stealing peeks at each other over newspapers.| In moments of danger, they made themselves| scarce.| Where did they all disappear?| I asked some mugger one night| While he held a knife to my throat,| But he was spooked too,| Letting me go without a word,| Skipping over rain puddles| As if chased by his own shadow.| It was disconcerting, not to say criminal.| Flustered as I was, I reached| For the little black comb| I keep tucked in my breast pocket,| To run it through my hair once,| And make absolutely certain| At least one of us was still here.| 
Working Late, by Louis Simpson| Poet| A light is on in my father's study.| "Still up?" he says, and we are silent,| looking at the harbor lights,| listening to the surf| and the creak of coconut boughs.| | He is working late on cases.| No impassioned speech! He argues from evidence,| actually pacing out and measuring,| while the fans revolving on the ceiling| winnow the true from the false.| | Once he passed a brass curtain rod| through a head made out of plaster| and showed the jury the angle of fire--| where the murderer must have stood.| For years, all through my childhood,| if I opened a closet . . . bang!| There would be the dead man's head| with a black hole in the forehead.| | All the arguing in the world| will not stay the moon.| She has come all the way from Russia| to gaze for a while in a mango tree| and light the wall of a veranda,| before resuming her interrupted journey| beyond the harbor and the lighthouse| at Port Royal, turning away| from land to the open sea.| | Yet, nothing in nature changes, from that day to this,| she is still the mother of us all.| I can see the drifting offshore lights,| black posts where the pelicans brood.| | And the light that used to shine| at night in my father's study| now shines as late in mine.| 
Cleaning a Fish, by Dave Smith| Poet| In her hand the knife, brisk, brilliant as moon-claw,| shaves the flesh. It grazes the white| belly just over the heart.| Underneath, the coiled fingers| are cradling a soft flesh| as if it were the jowls of the aged| | man propped for a while on the bench in the park.| The head is not severed, the eyes not out.| Blue, they appear to flash odd ways| where a tree makes a live shadow.| Mostly the eyes are dead.| Nothing is in them| | except the intense blue of sky the tree allows.| There is no conspiring of nerves,| no least event recalled| by a limb's high arching,| or even a girl's ascension| from a forgotten distance of water.| | But there is something as she lifts the meat.| It is enough to draw down her gaze.| Now her arm rises against| yellow hair fallen| white in a childish face.| She is still as a leaf barely clinging.| | I come to her like a cat in the stunned grass| and touch her to see the startled,| upthrusted gleam of her face.| At brow and each cheek| like gathered beads of mist| scales leap with the sun, and are dead.| | No word passes between us, but something electric| as a flash of steel makes her| cry out just once. Squatting| at the yard's edge, she| sings beyond any thought.| Her knife flies as lethal as love| and cuts quickly in like a hurried kiss.| 
Pacemaker, by W.D. Snodgrass| Poet| I| | "One Snodgrass, two Snodgrass, three Snodgrass, four . . .| I took my own rollcall when I counted seconds;| "One two three, Two two three, Three . . .," the drum score| Showed only long rests to the tympani's entrance.| | "Oh-oh-oh leff; leff; leff-toh-righ-toh-leff,"| The sergeant cadenced us footsore recruits;| The heart, poor drummer, gone lame, deaf,| Then AWOL, gets frogmarched to the noose.| | II| | Old coots, at the Veterans', might catch breath| If their cheeks got slapped by a nurse's aide,| Then come back to life; just so, at their birth,| Young rumps had been tendered warm accolades.| | The kick-ass rude attitude, smart-assed insult,| The acid-fueled book review just might shock| Us back to the brawl like smelling salts,| Might sting the lulled heart up off its blocks.| | III| | I thought I'd always favor rubato| Or syncopation, scorning fixed rhythms;| Thought my old heartthrobs could stand up to stress;| Believed one's bloodpump should skip a few beats| If it fell into company with sleek young women;| Believed my own bruit could beat with the best.| | Wrong again, Snodgrass! This new gold gadget,| Snug as the watch on my wife's warm wrist,| Drives my pulsetempo near twice its old pace-| Go, nonstop startwatch! Go, clockwork rabbit,| Keeping this lame old dog synchronized,| Steady, sparked up, still in the race.| 
Hay for the Horses, by Gary Synder| Poet| He had driven half the night| From far down San Joaquin| Through Mariposa, up the| Dangerous Mountain roads,| And pulled in at eight a.m.| With his big truckload of hay| behind the barn.| With winch and ropes and hooks| We stacked the bales up clean| To splintery redwood rafters| High in the dark, flecks of alfalfa| Whirling through shingle-cracks of light,| Itch of haydust in the| sweaty shirt and shoes.| At lunchtime under Black oak| Out in the hot corral,| ---The old mare nosing lunchpails,| Grasshoppers crackling in the weeds---| "I'm sixty-eight" he said,| "I first bucked hay when I was seventeen.| I thought, that day I started,| I sure would hate to do this all my life.| And dammit, that's just what| I've gone and done."| 
Oranges, by Gary Soto| Poet| The first time I walked| With a girl, I was twelve,| Cold, and weighted down| With two oranges in my jacket.| December.  Frost cracking| Beneath my steps, my breath| Before me, then gone,| As I walked toward| Her house, the one whose| Porch light burned yellow| Night and day, in any weather.| A dog barked at me, until| She came out pulling| At her gloves, face bright| With rouge.  I smiled,| Touched her shoulder, and led| Her down the street, across| A used car lot and a line| Of newly planted trees,| Until we were breathing| Before a drugstore.  We| Entered, the tiny bell| Bringing a saleslady| Down a narrow aisle of goods.| I turned to the candies| Tiered like bleachers,| And asked what she wanted -| Light in her eyes, a smile| Starting at the corners| Of her mouth.  I fingered| A nickel in my pocket,| And when she lifted a chocolate| That cost a dime,| I didn't say anything.| I took the nickel from| My pocket, then an orange,| And set them quietly on| The counter.  When I looked up,| The lady's eyes met mine,| And held them, knowing| Very well what it was all| About.| | Outside,| A few cars hissing past,| Fog hanging like old| Coats between the trees.| I took my girl's hand| in mine for two blocks,| Then released it to let| Her unwrap the chocolate.| I peeled my orange| That was so bright against| The gray of December| That, from some distance,| Someone might have thought| I was making a fire in my hands.| 
Glass-Bottom Boat, by Elizabeth Spires| Poet| Key West| In the Cubano diner, tiny cups| of black, black coffee, hot and sweet,| and chipped blue china plates| of black beans and yellowtail,| fished by the fishermen| as the sun came up this morning.| | Yesterday out on the reef,| we looked through the floor of the boat,| through layers of clear, clean water-| windows looking into other windows-| down to the floor of the world,| shallow, pliant, and shifting.| There, schools of yellowtail| swam through the living coral,| bright as stained glass,| cast into underwater constellations| both strange and familiar:| a flower, a brain, a cathedral.| Suddenly a shadow parted the school-| as if a cloud had just blotted the sun-| a barracuda swerving as they swerved,| and nothing they could do.| After it fed, the two halves joined,| the missing ones unmourned,| all as it was before.| | If I could live for a thousand years,| ten thousand, would ever I see| the great family of men, women, and children,| both preying and preyed-upon,| swimming as freely as the yellowtail?| Would that be heaven or hell?| Each naked human face a candle| joining other candles in a procession| spanning many centuries, entering| the cathedral of live stone| whose heavy doors are cast| with scenes from our own lives,| moving as moving pictures move,| until the reel runs out.| In that world-without-end hour,| will the future read us in relief,| blindly touching each raised| and burnished scene with fingertips,| the ejaculate word forming on their lips,| an O! and then again an O!| of terror and astonishment?| O how will they sing knowing what they know?| Streaming through time, they see| our approach, we are plotted| in space, our light outlives our lives| and sends a signal far into| the future: the past is alive!| Dead and dark for a long time,| we are as stars to them,| stars wishing to be wished on.| 
Gin, by David St. John| Poet| There's a mystery| By the river, in one of the cabins| Shuttered with planks, its lock| Twisted; a bunch of magazines flipped open,| A body. A blanket stuffed with leaves| Or lengths of rope, an empty gin bottle.| Put down your newspaper. Look out| Beyond the bluffs, a coal barge is passing,| Its deck nearly| Level with the water, where it comes back riding| High. You start talking about nothing,| Or that famous party, where you went dressed| As a river. They listen,| The man beside you touching his odd face| In the countertop, the woman stirring tonic| In your glass. Down the bar the talk's divorce,| The docks, the nets| Filling with branches and sour fish. Listen,| I knew a woman who'd poke a hole in an egg, suck| It clean and fill the shell with gin,| Then walk around all day disgusting people| Until she was so drunk| The globe of gin broke in her hand. She'd stay| Alone at night on the boat, come back| Looking for another egg. That appeals to you, rocking| For hours carving at a hollow stone. Or finding| A trail by accident, walking the bluff's| Face. You know, your friends complain. They say| You give up only the vaguest news, and give a bakery| As your phone. Even your stories| Have no point, just lots of detail: The room| Was long and bright, small and close, angering Gaston;| They turned away to embrace him; She wore| The color out of season,| She wore hardly anything at all; Nobody died; Saturday.| These disguises of omission. Like forgetting| To say obtuse when you talk about the sun, leaving| Off the buttons as you're sewing up the coat. So,| People take the little| They know to make a marvelous stew;| Sometimes, it even resembles you. It's not so much| You cover your tracks, as that they bloom| In such false directions. This way friends who awaken| At night, beside you, awaken alone.| 
Traveling through the Dark, by William Stafford| Poet| Traveling through the dark I found a deer| dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.| It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:| that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.| | By glow of the tail-light I stumbled back of the car| and stood by the heap, a doe, a recent killing;| she had stiffened already, almost cold.| I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.| | My fingers touching her side brought me the reason--| her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,| alive, still, never to be born.| Beside that mountain road I hesitated.| | The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;| under the hood purred the steady engine.| I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;| around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.| | I thought hard for us all--my only swerving--,| then pushed her over the edge into the river.| 
Notice What This Poem Is Not Doing, by William Stafford| Poet| The light along the hills in the morning| comes down slowly, naming the trees| white, then coasting the ground for stones to nominate.| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | A house, a house, a barn, the old| quarry, where the river shrugs--| how much of this place is yours?| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | Every person gone has taken a stone| to hold, and catch the sun. The carving| says, "Not here, but called away."| | Notice what this poem is not doing.| | The sun, the earth, the sky, all wait.| The crowns and redbirds talk. The light| along the hills has come, has found you.| | Notice what this poem has not done.| 
The Dancing, by Gerald Stern| Poet| In all these rotten shops, in all this broken furniture| and wrinkled ties and baseball trophies and coffee pots| I have never seen a post-war Philco| with the automatic eye| nor heard Ravel's "Bolero" the way I did| in 1945 in that tiny living room| on Beechwood Boulevard, nor danced as I did| then, my knives all flashing, my hair all streaming,| my mother red with laughter, my father cupping| his left hand under his armpit, doing the dance| of old Ukraine, the sound of his skin half drum,| half fart, the world at last a meadow,| the three of us whirling and singing, the three of us| screaming and falling, as if we were dying,| as if we could never stop--in 1945--| in Pittsburgh, beautiful filthy Pittsburgh, home| of the evil Mellons, 5,000 miles away| from the other dancing--in Poland and Germany--| oh God of mercy, oh wild God.| 
The Prediction, by Mark Strand| Poet| That night the moon drifted over the pond,| turning the water to milk, and under| the boughs of the trees, the blue trees,| a young woman walked, and for an instant| | the future came to her:| rain falling on her husband's grave, rain falling| on the lawns of her children, her own mouth| filling with cold air, strangers moving into her house,| | a man in her room writing a poem, the moon drifting into it,| a woman strolling under its trees, thinking of death,| thinking of him thinking of her, and the wind rising| and taking the moon and leaving the paper dark.| 
The Night, The Porch, by Mark Strand| Poet| To stare at nothing is to learn by heart| What all of us will be swept into, and baring oneself| To the wind is feeling the ungraspable somewhere close by.| Trees can sway or be still. Day or night can be what they wish.| What we desire, more than a season or weather, is the comfort| Of being strangers, at least to ourselves. This is the crux| Of the matter. Even now we seem to be waiting for something| Whose appearance would be its vanishing--the sound, say,| Of a few leaves falling, or just one leaf, or less.| There is no end to what we can learn. The book out there| Tells as much, and was never written with us in mind.| 
Letter, by Jean Valentine| Poet| The hornet holds on to the curtain, winter| sleep. Rubs her legs. Climbs the curtain.| Behind her the cedars sleep lightly,| | like guests. But I am the guest.| The ghost cars climb the ghost highway. Even my hand| over the page       adds to the 'room tone': the little| | constant wind. The effort of becoming. These words| are my life. The effort| of loving the un-become. To make the suffering| | visible. The un-become love: What we| lost, a leaf, what we cherish, a leaf.| One leaf of grass. I'm sending you this seed-pod,| | this red ribbon, my tongue,| these two red ribbons, my mouth,| | my other mouth,| -but the other world-blindly I guzzle| the swimming milk of its seed field flower-| 
Year's End, by Ellen Bryant Voigt| Poet| The fingers lie in the lap,| separate, lonely, as in the field| the separate blades of grass| shrivel or grow tall.| | We sat together in the little room,| the walls blotched with steam,| holding the baby as if the two of us| could breathe for him and were not helpless.| Upstairs, his sister turned in her sleep| as the phone rang-| | to have wakened to a child's cry,| gagged and desperate,| and then repeat that terror when the call| split the quiet house and centered| its dire message:| a child was dead| and his mother so wrung by grief| she stared and stared| at the moon on its black stalk,| the road glistening like wire.| Rubbing the window clear of steam| as a child rubs sleep from its eyes,| and looking past the fence to where| he had plunged the sled up and down the hill,| we could still see the holes his feet made,| a staggered row of graves| extracting darkness from the snow.| When morning brought the new year in,| the fever broke, and fresh snow| bandaged the tracks on the hill.| For a long time we stayed in the room,| listening to him breathe,| like refugees who listen to the sea,| unable to fully rejoice, or fully grieve.| 
In Trackless Woods, by Richard Wilbur| Poet| In trackless woods, it puzzled me to find| Four great rock maples seemingly aligned,| As if they had been set out in a row| Before some house a century ago,| To edge the property and lend some shade.| I looked to see if ancient wheels had made| Old ruts to which the trees ran parallel,| But there were none, so far as I could tell -| There'd been no roadway. Nor could I find the square| Depression of a cellar anywhere,| And so I tramped on further, to survey| Amazing patterns in a hornbeam spray| Or spirals in a pine-cone, under trees| Not subject to our stiff geometries.| 
The Singing, by C. K. Williams| Poet| I was walking home down a hill near our house| on a balmy afternoon| under the blossoms| Of the pear trees that go flamboyantly mad here| every spring with| their burgeoning forth| | When a young man turned in from a corner singing| no it was more of| a cadenced shouting| Most of which I couldn't catch I thought because| the young man was| black speaking black| | It didn't matter I could tell he was making his| song up which pleased| me he was nice-looking| Husky dressed in some style of big pants obviously| full of himself| hence his lyrical flowing over| | We went along in the same direction then he noticed| me there almost| beside him and "Big"| He shouted-sang "Big" and I thought how droll| to have my height| incorporated in his song| | So I smiled but the face of the young man showed nothing| he looked| in fact pointedly away| And his song changed "I'm not a nice person"| he chanted "I'm not| I'm not a nice person"| | No menace was meant I gathered no particular threat| but he did want| to be certain I knew| That if my smile implied I conceived of anything like concord| between us I should forget it| | That's all nothing else happened his song became| indecipherable to| me again he arrived| Where he was going a house where a girl in braids| waited for him on| the porch that was all| | No one saw no one heard all the unasked and| unanswered questions| were left where they were| It occurred to me to sing back "I'm not a nice| person either" but I| couldn't come up with a tune| | Besides I wouldn't have meant it nor he have believed| it both of us| knew just where we were| In the duet we composed the equation we made| the conventions to| which we were condemned| | Sometimes it feels even when no one is there that| someone something| is watching and listening| Someone to rectify redo remake this time again though| no one saw nor| heard no one was there| 
More Blues and the Abstract Truth, by C.D. Write| Poet| I back the car over a soft, large object;| hair appears on my chest in dreams.| The paperboy comes to collect| with a pit bull. Call Grandmother| and she says, Well you know| death is death and none other.| | In the mornings we're in the dark;| even at the end of June| the zucchini keep on the sill.| Ring Grandmother for advice| and she says, O you know| I used to grow so many things.| | Then there's the frequent bleeding,| the tender nipples, and the rot| under the floormat. If I'm not seeing| a cold-eyed doctor it is| another gouging mechanic.| Grandmother says, Thanks to the blue rugs| and Eileen Briscoe's elms| the house keeps cool.| | Well. Then. You say Grandmother| let me just ask you this:| How does a body rise up again and rinse| her mouth from the tap. And how| does a body put in a plum tree| or lie again on top of another body| or string a trellis. Or go on drying| the flatware. Fix rainbow trout. Grout the tile.| Buy a bag of onions. Beat an egg stiff. Yes,| how does the cat continue| to lick itself from toenail to tailhole.| And how does a body break| bread with the word when the word| has broken. Again. And. Again.| With the wine. And the loaf.| And the excellent glass| of the body. And she says,| Even. If. The. Sky. Is. Falling.| My. Peace. Rose. Is. In. Bloom.| 
Approximately Forever, by C.D.

Clear Night, by Charles Wright| Poet| Clear night, thumb-top of a moon, a back-lit sky.| Moon-fingers lay down their same routine| On the side deck and the threshold, the white keys and the black keys.| Bird hush and bird song. A cassia flower falls.| | I want to be bruised by God.| I want to be strung up in a strong light and singled out.| I want to be stretched, like music wrung from a dropped seed.| I want to be entered and picked clean.| | And the wind says "What?" to me.| And the castor beans, with their little earrings of death, say "What?" to me.| And the stars start out on their cold slide through the dark.| And the gears notch and the engines wheel.| 
Lying in a Hammock at William Duffy's Farm in Pine Island, Minnesota, by James Wright| Poet| Over my head, I see the bronze butterfly,| Asleep on the black trunk,| Blowing like a leaf in green shadow.| Down the ravine behind the empty house,| The cowbells follow one another| Into the distances of the afternoon.| To my right,| In a field of sunlight between two pines,| The droppings of last year's horses| Blaze up into golden stones.| I lean back, as the evening darkens and comes on.| A chicken hawk floats over, looking for home.| I have wasted my life.| 
A Blessing, by James Wright| Poet| Just off the highway to Rochester, Minnesota,| Twilight bounds softly forth on the grass.| And the eyes of those two Indian ponies| Darken with kindness.| They have come gladly out of the willows| To welcome my friend and me.| We step over the barbed wire into the pasture| Where they have been grazing all day, alone.| They ripple tensely, they can hardly contain their happiness| That we have come.| They bow shyly as wet swans. They love each other.| There is no loneliness like theirs.| At home once more,| They begin munching the young tufts of spring in the darkness.| I would like to hold the slenderer one in my arms,| For she has walked over to me| And nuzzled my left hand.| She is black and white,| Her mane falls wild on her forehead,| And the light breeze moves me to caress her long ear| That is delicate as the skin over a girl's wrist.| Suddenly I realize| That if I stepped out of my body I would break| Into blossom.|

Growing Old, by Matthew Arnold| 19th| What is it to grow old?| Is it to lose the glory of the form,| The lustre of the eye?| Is it for beauty to forego her wreath?| Yes, but not for this alone.| | Is it to feel our strength-| Not our bloom only, but our strength-decay?| Is it to feel each limb| Grow stiffer, every function less exact,| Each nerve more weakly strung?| | Yes, this, and more! but not,| Ah, 'tis not what in youth we dreamed 'twould be!| 'Tis not to have our life| Mellowed and softened as with sunset-glow,| A golden day's decline!| | 'Tis not to see the world| As from a height, with rapt prophetic eyes,| And heart profoundly stirred;| And weep, and feel the fulness of the past,| The years that are no more!| | It is to spend long days| And not once feel that we were ever young.| It is to add, immured| In the hot prison of the present, month| To month with weary pain.| | It is to suffer this,| And feel but half, and feebly, what we feel:| Deep in our hidden heart| Festers the dull remembrance of a change,| But no emotion-none.| | It is-last stage of all-| When we are frozen up within, and quite| The phantom of ourselves,| To hear the world applaud the hollow ghost| Which blamed the living man.| 
Twenty-First. Night. Monday, by Anna Akhmatova| 19th| Twenty-first. Night. Monday.| Silhouette of the capitol in darkness.| Some good-for-nothing -- who knows why --| made up the tale that love exists on earth.| | People believe it, maybe from laziness| or boredom, and live accordingly:| they wait eagerly for meetings, fear parting,| and when they sing, they sing about love.| | But the secret reveals itself to some,| and on them silence settles down. | I found this out by accident| and now it seems I'm sick all the time.| 
Autumnal Sonnet, by William Allingham| 19th| Now Autumn's fire burns slowly along the woods,| And day by day the dead leaves fall and melt,| And night by night the monitory blast| Wails in the key-hold, telling how it pass'd| O'er empty fields, or upland solitudes,| Or grim wide wave; and now the power is felt| Of melancholy, tenderer in its moods| Than any joy indulgent summer dealt.| Dear friends, together in the glimmering eve,| Pensive and glad, with tones that recognise| The soft invisible dew in each one's eyes,| It may be, somewhat thus we shall have leave| To walk with memory,--when distant lies| Poor Earth, where we were wont to live and grieve.| 
The Window, by Conrad Aiken| 19th| She looks out in the blue morning| and sees a whole wonderful world| she looks out in the morning| and sees a whole world| | she leans out of the window| and this is what she sees| a wet rose singing to the sun| with a chorus of red bees| | she leans out of the window| and laughs for the window is high| she is in it like a bird on a perch| and they scoop the blue sky| | she and the window scooping| the morning as if it were air| scooping a green wave of leaves| above a stone stair| | and an urn hung with leaden garlands| and girls holding hands in a ring| and raindrops on an iron railing| shining like a harp string| | an old man draws with his ferrule| in wet sand a map of Spain| the marble soldier on his pedestal| draws a stiff diagram of pain| | but the walls around her tremble| with the speed of the earth the floor| curves to the terrestrial center| and behind her the door| | opens darkly down to the beginning| far down to the first simple cry| and the animal waking in water| and the opening of the eye| | she looks out in the blue morning| and sees a whole wonderful world| she looks out in the morning| and sees a whole world.| 
Sonnet 32 - The first time that the sun rose on thine oath, by Elizabeth Barrett Browning| 19th| The first time that the sun rose on thine oath| To love me, I looked forward to the moon| To slacken all those bonds which seemed too soon| And quickly tied to make a lasting troth.| Quick-loving hearts, I thought, may quickly loathe;| And, looking on myself, I seemed not one| For such man's love!-more like an out-of-tune| Worn viol, a good singer would be wroth| To spoil his song with, and which, snatched in haste,| Is laid down at the first ill-sounding note.| I did not wrong myself so, but I placed| A wrong on thee. For perfect strains may float| 'Neath master-hands, from instruments defaced,-| And great souls, at one stroke, may do and doat.| 
My Last Duchess, by Robert Browning| 19th| That's my last duchess painted on the wall,| Looking as if she were alive. I call| That piece a wonder, now: Frà Pandolf's hands| Worked busily a day, and there she stands.| Will't please you sit and look at her? I said| "Frà Pandolf" by design, for never read| Strangers like you that pictured countenance,| The depth and passion of its earnest glance,| But to myself they turned (since none puts by| The curtain I have drawn for you, but I)| And seemed as they would ask me, if they durst,| How such a glance came there; so, not the first| Are you to turn and ask thus. Sir, 'twas not| Her husband's presence only, called that spot| Of joy into the Duchess' cheek: perhaps| Frà Pandolf chanced to say "Her mantle laps| "Over my lady's wrist too much," or "Paint| "Must never hope to reproduce the faint| "Half-flush that dies along her throat": such stuff| Was courtesy, she thought, and cause enough| For calling up that spot of joy. She had| A heart--how shall I say?--too soon made glad,| Too easily impressed; she liked whate'er| She looked on, and her looks went everywhere.| Sir, 'twas all one! My favor at her breast,| The dropping of the daylight in the West,| The bough of cherries some officious fool| Broke in the orchard for her, the white mule| She rode with round the terrace--all and each| Would draw from her alike the approving speech,| Or blush, at least. She thanked men--good! but thanked| Somehow--I know not how--as if she ranked| My gift of a nine-hundred-years-old name| With anybody's gift. Who'd stoop to blame| This sort of trifling? Even had you skill| In speech--which I have not--to make your will| Quite clear to such an one, and say, "Just this| "Or that in you disgusts me; here you miss,| "Or there exceed the mark"--and if she let| Herself be lessoned so, nor plainly set| Her wits to yours, forsooth, and make excuse,| --E'en then would be some stooping; and I choose| Never to stoop. Oh sir, she smiled, no doubt,| Whene'er I passed her; but who passed without| Much the same smile? This grew; I gave commands;| Then all smiles stopped together. There she stands| As if alive. Will't please you rise? We'll meet| The company below, then. I repeat,| The Count your master's known munificence| Is ample warrant that no just pretense| Of mine for dowry will be disallowed;| Though his fair daughter's self, as I avowed| At starting, is my object. Nay we'll go| Together down, sir. Notice Neptune, though,| Taming a sea-horse, thought a rarity,| Which Claus of Innsbruck cast in bronze for me!| 
My Earlier Life, by Charles Baudelaire| 19th| I've been home a long time among the vast porticos,| Which the mariner sun has tinged with a million fires,| Whose grandest pillars, upright, majestic and cold| Render them the same, this evening, as caves with basalt spires.| | The swells' overwhelming accords of rich music,| Heaving images of heaven to the skies,| Mingle in a way solemn and mystic| With the colors of the horizon reflected by my eyes.| | It was here I was true to the voluptuous calm,| The milieu of azure, the waves, the splendors,| And the nude slaves, all impregnated with odors,| | Who refreshed my brow with waving palms| My only care to bring to meaning from anguish| The sad secret in which I languish.| 
The South Country, by Hilaire Belloc| 19th| When I am living in the Midlands| That are sodden and unkind,| I light my lamp in the evening:| My work is left behind;| And the great hills of the South Country| Come back into my mind.| | The great hills of the South Country| They stand along the sea;| And it's there walking in the high woods| That I could wish to be,| And the men that were boys when I was a boy| Walking along with me.| | The men that live in North England| I saw them for a day:| Their hearts are set upon the waste fells,| Their skies are fast and grey;| From their castle-walls a man may see| The mountains far away.| | The men that live in West England| They see the Severn strong,| A-rolling on rough water brown| Light aspen leaves along.| They have the secret of the Rocks,| And the oldest kind of song.| | But the men that live in the South Country| Are the kindest and most wise,| They get their laughter from the loud surf,| And the faith in their happy eyes| Comes surely from our Sister the Spring| When over the sea she flies;| The violets suddenly bloom at her feet,| She blesses us with surprise.| | I never get between the pines| But I smell the Sussex air;| Nor I never come on a belt of sand| But my home is there.| And along the sky the line of the Downs| So noble and so bare.| | A lost thing could I never find,| Nor a broken thing mend:| And I fear I shall be all alone| When I get towards the end.| Who will there be to comfort me| Or who will be my friend?| | I will gather and carefully make my friends| Of the men of the Sussex Weald;| They watch the stars from silent folds,| They stiffly plough the field.| By them and the God of the South Country| My poor soul shall be healed.| | If I ever become a rich man,| Or if ever I grow to be old,| I will build a house with deep thatch| To shelter me from the cold,| And there shall the Sussex songs be sung| And the story of Sussex told.| | I will hold my house in the high wood| Within a walk of the sea,| And the men that were boys when I was a boy| Shall sit and drink with me.| 
The General Public, by Stephen Vincent Benet| 19th| "Ah, did you once see Shelley plain?" -- Browning.| "Shelley? Oh, yes, I saw him often then,"| The old man said. A dry smile creased his face| With many wrinkles. "That's a great poem, now!| That one of Browning's! Shelley? Shelley plain?| The time that I remember best is this --| | A thin mire crept along the rutted ways,| And all the trees were harried by cold rain| That drove a moment fiercely and then ceased,| Falling so slow it hung like a grey mist| Over the school. The walks were like blurred glass.| The buildings reeked with vapor, black and harsh| Against the deepening darkness of the sky;| And each lamp was a hazy yellow moon,| Filling the space about with golden motes,| And making all things larger than they were.| One yellow halo hung above a door,| That gave on a black passage. Round about| Struggled a howling crowd of boys, pell-mell,| Pushing and jostling like a stormy sea,| With shouting faces, turned a pasty white| By the strange light, for foam. They all had clods,| Or slimy balls of mud. A few gripped stones.| And there, his back against the battered door,| His pile of books scattered about his feet,| Stood Shelley while two others held him fast,| And the clods beat upon him. 'Shelley! Shelley!'| The high shouts rang through all the corridors,| 'Shelley! Mad Shelley! Come along and help!'| And all the crowd dug madly at the earth,| Scratching and clawing at the streaming mud,| And fouled each other and themselves. And still| Shelley stood up. His eyes were like a flame| Set in some white, still room; for all his face| Was white, a whiteness like no human color,| But white and dreadful as consuming fire.| His hands shook now and then, like slender cords| Which bear too heavy weights. He did not speak.| So I saw Shelley plain."| "And you?" I said.| | "I? I threw straighter than the most of them,| And had firm clods. I hit him -- well, at least| Thrice in the face. He made good sport that night."| 
Epitaph For A Romantic Woman, by Louise Bogan| 19th| She has attained the permanence| She dreamed of, where old stones lie sunning.| Untended stalks blow over her| Even and swift, like young men running.| | Always in the heart she loved| Others had lived, -- she heard their laughter.| She lies where none has lain before,| Where certainly none will follow after.| 
Victory, by Rupert Brooke| 19th| All night the ways of Heaven were desolate,| Long roads across a gleaming empty sky.| Outcast and doomed and driven, you and I,| Alone, serene beyond all love or hate,| Terror or triumph, were content to wait,| We, silent and all-knowing. Suddenly| Swept through the heaven low-crouching from on high,| One horseman, downward to the earth's low gate.| | Oh, perfect from the ultimate height of living,| Lightly we turned, through wet woods blossom-hung,| Into the open. Down the supernal roads,| With plumes a-tossing, purple flags far flung,| Rank upon rank, unbridled, unforgiving,| Thundered the black battalions of the Gods.| 
I Never Loved You More, by Bertolt Brecht| 19th| I never loved you more, ma soeur| Than as I walked away from you that evening.| The forest swallowed me, the blue forest, ma soeur| The blue forest and above it pale stars in the west.| | I did not laugh, not one little bit, ma soeur| As I playfully walked towards a dark fate--| While the faces behind me| Slowly paled in the evening of the blue forest.| | Everything was grand that one night, ma soeur| Never thereafter and never before--| I admit it: I was left with nothing but the big birds| And their hungry cries in the dark evening sky.| 
Stanza, by Emily Bronte| 19th| Often rebuked, yet always back returning| To those first feelings that were born with me,| And leaving busy chase of wealth and learning| For idle dreams of things which cannot be:| | Today, I will seek not the shadowy region;| Its unsustaining vastness waxes drear;| And visions rising, legion after legion,| Bring the unreal world too strangely near.| | I'll walk, but not in old heroic traces,| And not in paths of high morality,| And not among the half-distingusihed faces,| The clouded forms of long-past history.| | I'll walk where my own nature would be leading:| It vexes me to choose another guide:| Where the grey flocks in ferny glens are feeding;| Where the wild wind blows on the mountain side.| | What have those lonely mountains worth revealing?| More glory and more grief than I can tell:| The earth that wakes one human heart to feeling| Can centre both the worlds of heaven and hell.| 
The Missionary, by Charlotte Bronte| 19th| Lough, vessel, plough the British main,| Seek the free ocean's wider plain;| Leave English scenes and English skies,| Unbind, dissever English ties;| Bear me to climes remote and strange,| Where altered life, fast-following change,| Hot action, never-ceasing toil,| Shall stir, turn, dig, the spirit's soil;| Fresh roots shall plant, fresh seed shall sow,| Till a new garden there shall grow,| Cleared of the weeds that fill it now,-| Mere human love, mere selfish yearning,| Which, cherished, would arrest me yet.| I grasp the plough, there's no returning,| Let me, then, struggle to forget.| | But England's shores are yet in view,| And England's skies of tender blue| Are arched above her guardian sea.| I cannot yet Remembrance flee;| I must again, then, firmly face| That task of anguish, to retrace.| Wedded to home -I home forsake,| Fearful of change -I changes make;| Too fond of ease -I plunge in toil;| Lover of calm- I seek turmoil:| Nature and hostile Destiny| Stir in my heart a conflict wild;| And long and fierce the war will be| Ere duty both has reconciled.| | What other tie yet holds me fast| To the divorced, abandoned past?| Smouldering, on my heart's altar lies| The fire of some great sacrifice,| Not yet half quenched. The sacred steel| But lately struck my carnal will,| My life-long hope, first joy and last,| What I loved well, and clung to fast;| What I wished wildly to retain,| What I renounced with soul-felt pain;| What -when I saw it, axe-struck, perish-| Left me no joy on earth to cherish;| A man bereft -yet sternly now| I do confirm that Jephtha vow:| Shall I retract, or fear, or flee ?| Did Christ, when rose the fatal tree| Before him, on Mount Calvary ?| 'Twas a long fight, hard fought, but won,| And what I did was justly done.| | Yet, Helen ! from thy love I turned,| When my heart most for thy heart burned;| I dared thy tears, I dared thy scorn-| Easier the death-pang had been borne.| Helen ! thou mightst not go with me,| I could not- dared not stay for thee !| I heard, afar, in bonds complain| The savage from beyond the main;| And that wild sound rose o'er the cry| Wrung out by passion's agony;| And even when, with the bitterest tear| I ever shed, mine eyes were dim,| Still, with the spirit's vision clear,| I saw Hell's empire, vast and grim,| Spread on each Indian river's shore,| Each realm of Asia covering o'er.| | There the weak, trampled by the strong,| Live but to suffer -hopeless die;| There pagan-priests, whose creed is Wrong,| Extortion, Lust, and Cruelty,| Crush our lost race- and brimming fill| The bitter cup of human ill;| And I- who have the healing creed,| The faith benign of Mary's Son;| Shall I behold my brother's need| And selfishly to aid him shun ?| I -who upon my mother's knees,| In childhood, read Christ's written word,| Received his legacy of peace,| His holy rule of action heard;| I- in whose heart the sacred sense| Of Jesus' love was early felt;| Of his pure full benevolence,| His pitying tenderness for guilt;| His shepherd-care for wandering sheep,| For all weak, sorrowing, trembling things,| His mercy vast, his passion deep| Of anguish for man's sufferings;| I -schooled from childhood in such lore-| Dared I draw back or hesitate,| When called to heal the sickness sore| Of those far off and desolate ?| Dark, in the realm and shades of Death,| Nations and tribes and empires lie,| But even to them the light of Faith| Is breaking on their sombre sky:| And be it mine to bid them raise| Their drooped heads to the kindling scene,| And know and hail the sunrise blaze| Which heralds Christ the Nazarene.| I know how Hell the veil will spread| Over their brows and filmy eyes,| And earthward crush the lifted head| That would look up and seek the skies;| I know what war the fiend will wage| Against that soldier of the cross,| Who comes to dare his demon-rage,| And work his kingdom shame and loss.| Yes, hard and terrible the toil| Of him who steps on foreign soil,| Resolved to plant the gospel vine,| Where tyrants rule and slaves repine;| Eager to lift Religion's light| Where thickest shades of mental night| Screen the false god and fiendish rite;| Reckless that missionary blood,| Shed in wild wilderness and wood,| Has left, upon the unblest air,| The man's deep moan-the martyr's prayer.| I know my lot -I only ask| Power to fulfill the glorious task;| Willing the spirit, may the flesh| Strength for the day receive afresh.| May burning sun or deadly wind| Prevail not o'er an earnest mind;| May torments strange or direst death| Nor trample truth, nor baffle faith.| Though such blood-drops should fall from me| As fell in old Gethsemane,| Welcome the anguish, so it gave| More strength to work- more skill to save.| And, oh ! if brief must be my time,| If hostile hand or fatal clime| Cut short my course- still o'er my grave,| Lord, may thy harvest whitening wave.| So I the culture may begin,| Let others thrust the sickle in;| If but the seed will faster grow,| May my blood water what I sow !| | What ! have I ever trembling stood,| And feared to give to God that blood ?| What ! has the coward love of life| Made me shrink from the righteous strife ?| Have human passions, human fears| Severed me from those Pioneers,| Whose task is to march first, and trace| Paths for the progress of our race ?| It has been so; but grant me, Lord,| Now to stand steadfast by thy word !| Protected by salvation's helm,| Shielded by faith -with truth begirt,| To smile when trials seek to whelm| And stand 'mid testing fires unhurt !| Hurling hell's strongest bulwarks down,| Even when the last pang thrills my breast,| When Death bestows the Martyr's crown,| And calls me into Jesus' rest.| Then for my ultimate reward-| Then for the world-rejoicing word-| The voice from Father- Spirit -Son:| " Servant of God, well hast thou done !"| 
Dora, by Thomas Edward Brown| 19th| She knelt upon her brother's grave,| My little girl of six years old--| He used to be so good and brave,| The sweetest lamb of all our fold;| He used to shout, he used to sing,| Of all our tribe the little king--| And so unto the turf her ear she laid,| To hark if still in that dark place he play'd.| No sound! no sound!| Death's silence was profound;| And horror crept| Into her aching heart, and Dora wept.| If this is as it ought to be,| My God, I leave it unto Thee.| 
My Feet, by Gelett Burgess| 19th| My Feet they haul me Round the House,| They Hoist me up the Stairs;| I only have to Steer them, and| They Ride me Everywheres!| 
The Stranger, by Aleksandr Blok| 19th| The restaurants on hot spring evenings| Lie under a dense and savage air.| Foul drafts and hoots from dunken revelers| Contaminate the thoroughfare.| Above the dusty lanes of suburbia| Above the tedium of bungalows| A pretzel sign begilds a bakery| And children screech fortissimo.| | And every evening beyond the barriers| Gentlemen of practiced wit and charm| Go strolling beside the drainage ditches --| A tilted derby and a lady at the arm.| | The squeak of oarlocks comes over the lake water| A woman's shriek assaults the ear| While above, in the sky, inured to everything,| The moon looks on with a mindless leer.| | And every evening my one companion| Sits here, reflected in my glass.| Like me, he has drunk of bitter mysteries.| Like me, he is broken, dulled, downcast.| | | The sleepy lackeys stand beside tables| Waiting for the night to pass| And tipplers with the eyes of rabbits| Cry out: "In vino veritas!"| | And every evening (or am I imagining?)| Exactly at the appointed time| A girl's slim figure, silk raimented,| Glides past the window's mist and grime.| | And slowly passing throught the revelers,| Unaccompanied, always alone,| Exuding mists and secret fragrances,| She sits at the table that is her own.| | Something ancient, something legendary| Surrounds her presence in the room,| Her narrow hand, her silk, her bracelets,| Her hat, the rings, the ostrich plume.| | Entranced by her presence, near and enigmatic,| I gaze through the dark of her lowered veil| And I behold an enchanted shoreline| And enchanted distances, far and pale.| | I am made a guardian of the higher mysteries,| Someone's sun is entrusted to my control.| Tart wine has pierced the last convolution| of my labyrinthine soul.| | And now the drooping plumes of ostriches| Asway in my brain droop slowly lower| And two eyes, limpid, blue, and fathomless| Are blooming on a distant shore.| | Inside my soul a treasure is buried.| The key is mine and only mine.| How right you are, you drunken monster!| I know: the truth is in the wine.| 
While yet we wait for spring, and from the dry, by Robert Seymour Bridges| 19th| While yet we wait for spring, and from the dry| And blackening east that so embitters March,| Well-housed must watch grey fields and meadows parch,| And driven dust and withering snowflake fly;| Already in glimpses of the tarnish'd sky| The sun is warm and beckons to the larch,| And where the covert hazels interarch| Their tassell'd twigs, fair beds of primrose lie.| Beneath the crisp and wintry carpet hid| A million buds but stay their blossoming;| And trustful birds have built their nests amid| The shuddering boughs, and only wait to sing| Till one soft shower from the south shall bid,| And hither tempt the pilgrim steps of spring.| 
The Captive Dove, by Anne Bronte| 19th| Poor restless dove, I pity thee;| And when I hear thy plaintive moan,| I mourn for thy captivity,| And in thy woes forget mine own.| To see thee stand prepared to fly,| And flap those useless wings of thine,| And gaze into the distant sky,| Would melt a harder heart than mine.| | In vain - in vain! Thou canst not rise:| Thy prison roof confines thee there;| Its slender wires delude thine eyes,| And quench thy longings with despair.| | Oh, thou wert made to wander free| In sunny mead and shady grove,| And, far beyond the rolling sea,| In distant climes, at will to rove!| | Yet, hadst thou but one gentle mate| Thy little drooping heart to cheer,| And share with thee thy captive state,| Thou couldst be happy even there.| | Yes, even there, if, listening by,| One faithful dear companion stood,| While gazing on her full bright eye,| Thou mightst forget thy native wood.| | But thou, poor solitary dove,| Must make, unheard, thy joyless moan;| The heart, that Nature formed to love,| Must pine, neglected, and alone.| 
The Young that Died in Beauty, by William Barnes| 19th| If souls should only sheen so bright| In heaven as in e'thly light,| An' nothen better wer the cease,| How comely still, in sheape an' feace,| Would many reach thik happy pleace, -| The hopevul souls that in their prime| Ha' seem'd a-took avore their time, -| The young that died in beauty.| | But when woone's lim's ha' lost their strangth| A-tweilen drough a lifetime's langth,| An' over cheaks a-growen wold| The slowly-weasten years ha' roll'd| The deep'nen wrinkle's hollow vwold;| When life is ripe, then death do call| Vor less ov thought, than when do vall| On young vo'ks in their beauty.| | But pinen souls, wi' heads a-hung| In heavy sorrow vor the young,| The sister ov the brother dead,| The father wi' a child a-vled,| The husband when his bride ha' laid| Her head at rest, noo mwore to turn,| Have all a-vound the time to murn| Vor youth that died in beauty.| | An' yeet the church, where prayer do rise| Vrom thoughtvul souls, wi' downcast eyes,| An' village greens, a-beat half beare| By dancers that do meet, an' wear| Such merry looks at feast an' feair,| Do gather under leatest skies,| Their bloomen cheaks an' sparklen eyes,| Though young ha' died in beauty.| | But still the dead shall mwore than keep| The beauty ov their early sleep;| Where comely looks shall never wear| Uncomely, under tweil an' ceare.| The feair at death be always feair,| Still feair to livers' thought an' love,| An' feairer still to God above,| Than when they died in beauty.| 
The House That Was, by Laurence Binyon| 19th| Of the old house, only a few, crumbled| Courses of brick, smothered in nettle and dock,| Or a shaped stone lying mossy where it tumbled!| Sprawling bramble and saucy thistle mock| What once was fire-lit floor and private charm,| Whence, seen in a windowed picture, were hills fading| At night, and all was memory-coloured and warm,| And voices talked, secure of the wind's invading.| Of the old garden, only a stray shining| Of daffodil flames among April's Cuckoo-flowers| Or clustered aconite, mixt with weeds entwining!| But, dark and lofty, a royal cedar towers| By homelier thorns; and whether the rain drifts| Or sun scortches, he holds the downs in ken,| The western vales; his branchy tiers he lifts,| Older than many a generation of men.| 
At Variance, by Ellis Parker Butler| 19th| When with me the play she goes,| I much admire the buds and bows| And all that on Kate's headgear grows.| But when some other night I see| That hat between the stage and me,| My taste and Kate's do not agree.| 
Punctuality, by Lewis Carroll| 19th| Man Naturally loves delay,| And to procrastinate;| Business put off from day to day| Is always done to late.| | Let ever hour be in its place| Firm fixed, nor loosely shift,| And well enjoy the vacant space,| As though a birthday gift.| | And when the hour arrives, be there,| Where'er that "there" may be;| Uncleanly hands or ruffled hair| Let no one ever see.| | If dinner at "half-past" be placed,| At "half-past" then be dressed.| If at a "quarter-past" make haste| To be down with the rest| | Better to be before you time,| Than e're to be behind;| To open the door while strikes the chime,| That shows a punctual mind.| | Moral:| | Let punctuality and care| Seize every flitting hour,| So shalt thou cull a floweret fair,| E'en from a fading flower| 
In the night, by Stephen Crane| 19th| In the night| Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys,| And the peaks looked toward God alone.| "O Master that movest the wind with a finger,| Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.| Grant that we may run swiftly across the world| To huddle in worship at Thy feet."| | In the morning| A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles,| And the little black cities were apparent.| "O Master that knowest the meaning of raindrops,| Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.| Give voice to us, we pray, O Lord,| That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun."| | In the evening| The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights.| "O Master,| Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds,| Thou hast made us humble, idle futile peaks.| Thou only needest eternal patience;| We bow to Thy wisdom, O Lord --| Humble, idle, futile peaks."| | In the night| Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys,| And the peaks looked toward God alone.| 
Independence, by Aleister Crowley| 19th| Come to my arms --- is it eve? is it morn?| Is Apollo awake? Is Diana reborn?| Are the streams in full song? Do the woods whisper hush| Is it the nightingale? Is it the thrush?| Is it the smile of the autumn, the blush| Of the spring? Is the world full of peace or alarms?| Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms!| | Come to my arms, though the hurricane blow.| Thunder and summer, or winter and snow,| It is one to us, one, while our spirits are curled| In the crimson caress: we are fond, we are furled| Like lilies away from the war of the world.| Are there spells beyond ours? Are there alien charms?| Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms!| | Come to my arms! is it life? is it death?| Is not all immortality born of your breath?| Are not heaven and hell but as handmaids of yours| Who are all that enflames, who are all that allures,| Who are all that destroys, who are all that endures?| I am yours, do I care if it heals me or harms?| Come to my arms, Laylah, come to my arms!| 
To Memory, by Mary Elizabeth Coleridge| 19th| Strange Power, I know not what thou art,| Murderer or mistress of my heart.| I know I'd rather meet the blow| Of my most unrelenting foe| Than live---as now I live---to be| Slain twenty times a day by thee.| | Yet, when I would command thee hence,| Thou mockest at the vain pretence,| Murmuring in mine ear a song| Once loved, alas! forgotten long;| And on my brow I feel a kiss| That I would rather die than miss.| 
The Visible, The Untrue, by Hart Crane| 19th| Yes, I being| the terrible puppet of my dreams, shall| lavish this on you-| the dense mine of the orchid, split in two.| And the fingernails that cinch such| environs?| And what about the staunch neighbor tabulations,| with all their zest for doom?| | I'm wearing badges| that cancel all your kindness. Forthright| I watch the silver Zeppelin| destroy the sky. To| stir your confidence?| To rouse what sanctions-?| | The silver strophe.  the canto| bright with myth .  Such| distances leap landward without| evil smile. And, as for me. .| | The window weight throbs in its blind| partition. To extinguish what I have of faith.| Yes, light. And it is always| always, always the eternal rainbow| And it is always the day, the farewell day unkind.| 
With Whom is no Variableness, Neither Shadow of Turning, by Arthur Hugh Clough| 19th| It fortifies my soul to know| That, though I perish, Truth is so:| That, howsoe'er I stray and range,| Whate'er I do, Thou dost not change.| I steadier step when I recall| That, if I slip, Thou dost not fall.| 
Who Goes Home?, by G. K. Chesterton| 19th| In the city set upon slime and loam| They cry in their parliament 'Who goes home?'| And there comes no answer in arch or dome,| For none in the city of graves goes home.| Yet these shall perish and understand,| For God has pity on this great land.| | Men that are men again; who goes home?| Tocsin and trumpeter! Who goes home?| For there's blood on the field and blood on the foam| And blood on the body when Man goes home.| And a voice valedictory . . . Who is for Victory?| Who is for Liberty? Who goes home?| 
Since Nine O'Clock, by Constantine P. Cavafy| 19th| Half past twelve. Time has gone by quickly| since nine o'clock when I lit the lamp| and sat down here. I've been sitting without reading,| without speaking. Completely alone in the house,| whom could I talk to?| | Since nine o'clock when I lit the lamp| the shade of my young body| has come to haunt me, to remind me| of shut scented rooms,| of past sensual pleasure - what daring pleasure.| And it's also brought back to me| streets now unrecognizable,| bustling night clubs now closed,| theatres and cafes no longer here.| | The shade of my young body| also brought back the things that make us sad:| family grief, separations,| the feelings of my own people, feelings| of the dead so little acknowledged.| | Half past twelve. How the time has gone by.| Half past twelve. How the years have gone by.| 
The Heart of Night, by Bliss Carman| 19th| When all the stars are sown| Across the night-blue space,| With the immense unknown,| In silence face to face.| We stand in speechless awe| While Beauty marches by,| And wonder at the Law| Which wears such majesty.| How small a thing is man| In all that world-sown vast,| That he should hope or plan| Or dream his dream could last!| | O doubter of the light,| Confused by fear and wrong,| Lean on the heart of night| And let love make thee strong!| | The Good that is the True| Is clothed with Beauty still.| Lo, in their tent of blue,| The stars above the hill!| 
I died for Beauty -- but was scarce, by Emily Dickinson| 19th| I died for Beauty -- but was scarce| Adjusted in the Tomb| When One who died for Truth, was lain| In an adjoining room --| | He questioned softly "Why I failed"?| "For Beauty", I replied --| "And I -- for Truth -- Themself are One --| We Brethren, are", He said --| | And so, as Kinsmen, met a Night --| We talked between the Rooms --| Until the Moss had reached our lips --| And covered up -- our names -| 
Douglass, by Paul Laurence Dunbar| 19th| Ah, Douglass, we have fall'n on evil days,| Such days as thou, not even thou didst know,| When thee, the eyes of that harsh long ago| Saw, salient, at the cross of devious ways,| And all the country heard thee with amaze.| Not ended then, the passionate ebb and flow,| The awful tide that battled to and fro;| We ride amid a tempest of dispraise.| | Now, when the waves of swift dissension swarm,| And Honour, the strong pilot, lieth stark,| Oh, for thy voice high-sounding o'er the storm,| For thy strong arm to guide the shivering bark,| The blast-defying power of thy form,| To give us comfort through the lonely dark.| 
Pear Tree, by Hilda Doolittle| 19th| Silver dust| lifted from the earth,| higher than my arms reach,| you have mounted.| O silver,| higher than my arms reach| you front us with great mass;| | no flower ever opened| so staunch a white leaf,| no flower ever parted silver| from such rare silver;| | O white pear,| your flower-tufts,| thick on the branch,| bring summer and ripe fruits| in their purple hearts.| 
Departure, by Henry Van Dyke| 19th| Oh, why are you shining so bright, big Sun,| And why is the garden so gay?| Do you know that my days of delight are done,| Do you know I am going away?| If you covered your face with a cloud, I 'd dream| You were sorry for me in my pain,| And the heads of the flowers all bowed would seem| To be weeping with me in the rain.| | But why is your head so low, sweet heart,| And why are your eyes overcast?| Are they clouded because you know we must part,| Do you think this embrace is our last?| Then kiss me again, and again, and again,| Look up as you bid me good-bye!| For your face is too dear for the stain of a tear,| And your smile is the sun in my sky.| 
Money, by William Henry Davies| 19th| When I had money, money, O!| I knew no joy till I went poor;| For many a false man as a friend| Came knocking all day at my door.| Then felt I like a child that holds| A trumpet that he must not blow| Because a man is dead; I dared| Not speak to let this false world know.| Much have I thought of life, and seen| How poor men's hearts are ever light;| And how their wives do hum like bees| About their work from morn till night.| So, when I hear these poor ones laugh,| And see the rich ones coldly frown-| Poor men, think I, need not go up| So much as rich men should come down.| When I had money, money, O!| My many friends proved all untrue;| But now I have no money, O!| My friends are real, though very few.| 
Song of a Train, by John Davidson| 19th| A monster taught| To come to hand| Amain,| As swift as thought| Across the land| The train.| | The song it sings| Has an iron sound;| Its iron wings| Like wheels go round.| | Crash under bridges,| Flash over ridges,| And vault the downs;| The road is straight --| Nor stile, nor gate;| For milestones -- towns!| | Voluminous, vanishing, white,| The steam plume trails;| Parallel streaks of light,| THe polished rails.| | Oh, who can follow?| The little swallow,| The trout of the sky:| But the sun| Is outrun,| And Time passed by.| | O'er bosky dens,| By marsh and mead,| Forest and fens| Embodied speed| Is clanked and hurled;| O'er rivers and runnels;| And into the earth| And out again| In death and birth| That know no pain,| For the whole round world| Is a warren of railway tunnels.| | Hark! hark! hark!| It screams and cleaves the dark;| And the subterranean night| Is gilt with smoky light.| Then out again apace| It runs its thundering race,| The monster taught| To come to hand| Amain,| That swift as thought| Speeds through the land| The train.| 
Sky Song, by Robert Desnos| 19th| The flower of the Alps told the seashell: "You're shining"| The seashell told the sea: "You echo"| The sea told the boat: "You're shuddering"| The boat told the fire: "You're glowing brightly"| The fire told me: "I glow less brightly than her eyes"| The boat told me: "I shudder less than your heart does when she appears"| The sea told me: "I echo less than her name does in your love-making"| The seashell told me: "I shine less brightly than the phosphorus of desire in your hollow dream"| The flower of the Alps told me: "She's beautiful"| I said: "She's beautiful, so beautiful, she moves me."| 
Spring Thunder, by Mark van Doren| 19th| Listen, The wind is still,| And far away in the night --| See! The uplands fill| With a running light.| | Open the doors. It is warm;| And where the sky was clear--| Look! The head of a storm| That marches here!| | Come under the trembling hedge--| Fast, although you fumble. | There! Did you hear the edge| of winter crumble| 
The Moon Maiden's Song, by Ernest Dowson| 19th| Sleep! Cast thy canopy| Over this sleeper's brain,| Dim grow his memory,| When he wake again.| | Love stays a summer night,| Till lights of morning come;| Then takes her winged flight| Back to her starry home.| | Sleep! Yet thy days are mine;| Love's seal is over thee:| Far though my ways from thine,| Dim though thy memory.| | Love stays a summer night,| Till lights of morning come;| Then takes her winged flight| Back to her starry home.| 
Portrait of a Lady, by T. S. Eliot| 19th| Thou hast committed-| Fornication: but that was in another country,| And besides, the wench is dead.| | The Jew of Malta.| | | I| | AMONG the smoke and fog of a December afternoon| You have the scene arrange itself-as it will seem to do-| With "I have saved this afternoon for you";| And four wax candles in the darkened room,| Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead,| An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb| Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid.| We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole| Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and fingertips.| "So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul| Should be resurrected only among friends| Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom| That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."| -And so the conversation slips| Among velleities and carefully caught regrets| Through attenuated tones of violins| Mingled with remote cornets| And begins.| | "You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends,| And how, how rare and strange it is, to find| In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends,| [For indeed I do not love it .  you knew? you are not blind!| How keen you are!]| To find a friend who has these qualities,| Who has, and gives| Those qualities upon which friendship lives.| How much it means that I say this to you-| Without these friendships-life, what cauchemar!"| | Among the windings of the violins| And the ariettes| Of cracked cornets| Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins| Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own,| Capricious monotone| That is at least one definite "false note."| -Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance,| Admire the monuments,| Discuss the late events,| Correct our watches by the public clocks.| Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks.| | II| | Now that lilacs are in bloom| She has a bowl of lilacs in her room| And twists one in his fingers while she talks.| "Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know| What life is, you who hold it in your hands";| (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks)| "You let it flow from you, you let it flow,| And youth is cruel, and has no remorse| And smiles at situations which it cannot see."| I smile, of course,| And go on drinking tea.| "Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall| My buried life, and Paris in the Spring,| I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world| To be wonderful and youthful, after all."| | The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune| Of a broken violin on an August afternoon:| "I am always sure that you understand| My feelings, always sure that you feel,| Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand.| | You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel.| You will go on, and when you have prevailed| You can say: at this point many a one has failed.| | But what have I, but what have I, my friend,| To give you, what can you receive from me?| Only the friendship and the sympathy| Of one about to reach her journey's end.| | I shall sit here, serving tea to friends. "| | I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends| For what she has said to me?| You will see me any morning in the park| Reading the comics and the sporting page.| Particularly I remark| An English countess goes upon the stage.| A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance,| Another bank defaulter has confessed.| I keep my countenance,| I remain self-possessed| Except when a street piano, mechanical and tired| Reiterates some worn-out common song| With the smell of hyacinths across the garden| Recalling things that other people have desired.| Are these ideas right or wrong?| | III| | The October night comes down; returning as before| Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease| I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door| And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees.| "And so you are going abroad; and when do you return?| But that's a useless question.| You hardly know when you are coming back,| You will find so much to learn."| My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac.| | "Perhaps you can write to me."| My self-possession flares up for a second;| This is as I had reckoned.| "I have been wondering frequently of late| (But our beginnings never know our ends!)| Why we have not developed into friends."| I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark| Suddenly, his expression in a glass.| My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark.| | "For everybody said so, all our friends,| They all were sure our feelings would relate| So closely! I myself can hardly understand.| We must leave it now to fate.| You will write, at any rate.| Perhaps it is not too late.| I shall sit here, serving tea to friends."| | And I must borrow every changing shape| To find expression .  dance, dance| Like a dancing bear,| Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape.| Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance-| | Well! and what if she should die some afternoon,| Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose;| Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand| With the smoke coming down above the housetops;| Doubtful, for a while| Not knowing what to feel or if I understand| Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon. | Would she not have the advantage, after all?| This music is successful with a "dying fall"| Now that we talk of dying-| And should I have the right to smile?| 
Ode To Beauty, by Ralph Waldo Emerson| 19th| Who gave thee, O Beauty!| The keys of this breast,| Too credulous lover| Of blest and unblest?| Say when in lapsed ages| Thee knew I of old;| Or what was the service| For which I was sold?| When first my eyes saw thee,| I found me thy thrall,| By magical drawings,| Sweet tyrant of all!| I drank at thy fountain| False waters of thirst;| Thou intimate stranger,| Thou latest and first!| Thy dangerous glances| Make women of men;| New-born we are melting| Into nature again.| Lavish, lavish promiser,| Nigh persuading gods to err,| Guest of million painted forms| Which in turn thy glory warms,| The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,| The acorn's cup, the raindrop's arc,| The swinging spider's silver line,| The ruby of the drop of wine,| The shining pebble of the pond,| Thou inscribest with a bond| In thy momentary play| Would bankrupt Nature to repay.| | Ah! what avails it| To hide or to shun| Whom the Infinite One| Hath granted his throne?| The heaven high over| Is the deep's lover,| The sun and sea| Informed by thee,| Before me run,| And draw me on,| Yet fly me still,| As Fate refuses| To me the heart Fate for me chooses,| Is it that my opulent soul| Was mingled from the generous whole,| Sea valleys and the deep of skies| Furnished several supplies,| And the sands whereof I'm made| Draw me to them self-betrayed?| I turn the proud portfolios| Which hold the grand designs| Of Salvator, of Guercino,| And Piranesi's lines.| I hear the lofty Pæans| Of the masters of the shell,| Who heard the starry music,| And recount the numbers well:| Olympian bards who sung| Divine Ideas below,| Which always find us young,| And always keep us so.| Oft in streets or humblest places| I detect far wandered graces,| Which from Eden wide astray| In lowly homes have lost their way.| | Thee gliding through the sea of form,| Like the lightning through the storm,| Somewhat not to be possessed,| Somewhat not to be caressed,| No feet so fleet could ever find,| No perfect form could ever bind.| Thou eternal fugitive| Hovering over all that live,| Quick and skilful to inspire| Sweet extravagant desire,| Starry space and lily bell| Filling with thy roseate smell,| Wilt not give the lips to taste| Of the nectar which thou hast.| | All that's good and great with thee| Stands in deep conspiracy.| Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely| To report thy features only,| And the cold and purple morning| Itself with thoughts of thee adorning,| The leafy dell, the city mart,| Equal trophies of thine art,| E'en the flowing azure air| Thou hast touched for my despair,| And if I languish into dreams,| Again I meet the ardent beams.| Queen of things! I dare not die| In Being's deeps past ear and eye,| Lest there I find the same deceiver,| And be the sport of Fate forever.| Dread power, but dear! if God thou be,| Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me.| 
Other Children, by Paul Eluard| 19th| "Little child of my five senses| and of my tenderness."| Let us cradle our loves,| We will have good children.| Well cared for,| We will fear nothing on earth,| Happiness, good fortune, prudence,| Our loves| | And this leap from age to age,| From the order of a child to that of an old man,| Will not diminish us.| (Confidence).| 
Henry the Seventh, by Marriott Edgar| 19th| Henry the Seventh of England| Wasn't out of the Royal top drawer,| The only connection of which he could boast,| He were King's nephew's brother-in-law.| | It were after the Wars of the Roses| That he came to the front, as it were,| When on strength of his having slain Richard the Third| He put himself up as his heir.| | T'were a bit of a blow to the Barons| When Henry aspired to the Throne,| And some who'd been nursing imperial hopes| Started pushing out claims of their own.| | But they didn't get far with their scheming,| For the moment the matter were pressed| A stroke of the pen took them off to the Tower,| Where a stroke of the axe did the rest.| | A feller they called Perkin Warbeck| Was the one who led Henry a dance,| To make sure that nowt awkward should happen to him| He worked from an office in France.| | He claimed to be one of the Princes| As were smothered to death in the Tower.| His tale was that only his brother was killed| And that he had escaped the seas ower.| | Henry knew the appeal of the Princes| Was a strong one for Perkin to make,| And he reckoned he'd best have a chat with the lad| And find out the least he would take.| | In reply to his kind invitation| Perkin said he'd he happy to call,| But he'd bring his own escort of ten thousand men| And a hundred pipers an' all.| | This reply put the King in a passion| He swore as he'd stop Perkin's fun,| Then he offered a fortune per annum to him| As could tell him how his could be done.| | Then up spoke the bold Lambert Simne| The King's private scullion he were,| He said: "Just one word in thy ear 'ole, O King,| I've a plan as will stop all this 'ere."| | Then he took the King up in a corner,| Where no one could hear what they said,| He hadn't got far when King started to laff| And he laffed till he had to he bled.| | T 'were a plan to anticipate Perkin,| By getting in first with these tales,| Start another rebellion before he arrived| And take the wind out of his sails.| | And so Lambert Simnel's rebellion| Made its fateful debut in the North| Experts disagree who he made out to be,| John the Second or Richard the Fourth.| | T 'was surprising how many believed him| They flocked to his flag like one man,| For in them days the folk would do owt for a change,| And their motto was, " San fairy ann."| | It were quite a success this rebellion| Till t'were routed by Henry at Stoke,| And Lambert were taken and made to confess| That his parents was working class folk.| | The public forgave this deception,| The thing that made them proper mad| Was a twopenny increase on every one's rates| To pay for the fun they had had.| | And so when Peter Warbeck came over| Expecting his praise to be sung,| He was greeted, defeated, escheated, unseated,| Maltreated and finally hung.| | And the Baron went back to his castle,| The Peasant went back to his herd,| Lambert Simnel went back to his scullion's job| Because Henry went back on his word.| 
Dust of Snow, by Robert Frost| 19th| The way a crow| Shook down on me| The dust of snow| From a hemlock tree| Has given my heart| A change of mood| And saved some part| Of a day I had rued.| 
A Valentine, by Eugene Field| 19th| Go, Cupid, and my sweetheart tell| I love her well.| Yes, though she tramples on my heart| And rends that bleeding thing apart;| And though she rolls a scornful eye| On doting me when I go by;| And though she scouts at everything| As tribute unto her I bring -| Apple, banana, caramel -| Haste, Cupid, to my love and tell,| In spite of all, I love her well!| | And further say I have a sled| Cushioned in blue and painted red!| The groceryman has promised I| Can "hitch" whenever he goes by -| Go, tell her that, and, furthermore,| Apprise my sweetheart that a score| Of other little girls implore| The boon of riding on that sled| Painted and hitched, as aforesaid; -| And tell her, Cupid, only she| Shall ride upon that sled with me!| Tell her this all, and further tell| I love her well.| 
On Giving, by Robert Graves| 19th| Those who dare give nothing| Are left with less than nothing;| Dear heart, you give me everything,| Which leaves you more than everything-| Though those who dare give nothing| Might judge it left you less than nothing.| | Giving you everything,| I too, who once had nothing,| Am left with more than everything| As gifts for those with nothing| Who need, if not our everything,| At least a loving something.| 
O Singer in Brown by Dame Mary Gilmore| 19th| O, singer in brown!| O, bird o' th' morn!| O, heart of delight| In th' deep o' th' thorn!| | Glad is thy song| Thou joy o' th' morn,| Thou palpitant throat| In the heart o' th' thorn!| | Thy song of the nest,| O, sweet o' th' morn!| A nest and an egg| In the thick o' th' thorn.| 
A Broken Appointment, by Thomas Hardy| 19th| You did not come,| And marching Time drew on, and wore me numb.| Yet less for loss of your dear presence there| Than that I thus found lacking in your make| That high compassion which can overbear| Reluctance for pure loving kindness' sake| Grieved I, when, as the hope-hour stroked its sum,| You did not come.| | You love me not,| And love alone can lend you loyalty;| --I know and knew it. But, unto the store| Of human deeds divine in all but name,| Was it not worth a little hour or more| To add yet this: Once you, a woman, came| To soothe a time-torn man; even though it be| You love me not.| 
Pied Beauty, by Gerard Manley Hopkins| 19th| Glory be to God for dappled things-| For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;| For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;| Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;| Landscape plotted and pieced-fold, fallow, and plough;| And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.| | All things counter, original, spare, strange;| Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)| With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;| He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:| Praise him.| 
The Boys, by Oliver Wendell Holmes| 19th| HAS there any old fellow got mixed with the boys?| If there has, take him out, without making a noise.| Hang the Almanac's cheat and the Catalogue's spite!| Old Time is a liar! We're twenty to-night!| | We're twenty! We're twenty! Who says we are more?| He's tipsy,-- young jackanapes!-- show him the door!| "Gray temples at twenty?"-- Yes ! white if we please;| Where the snow-flakes fall thickest there's nothing can freeze!| | Was it snowing I spoke of? Excuse the mistake!| Look close,-- you will see not a sign of a flake!| We want some new garlands for those we have shed,--| And these are white roses in place of the red.| | We've a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told,| Of talking (in public) as if we were old:--| That boy we call "Doctor," and this we call "Judge;"| It's a neat little fiction,-- of course it's all fudge.| | That fellow's the "Speaker,"-- the one on the right;| "Mr. Mayor," my young one, how are you to-night?| That's our "Member of Congress," we say when we chaff;| There's the "Reverend" What's his name?-- don't make me laugh.| | That boy with the grave mathematical look| Made believe he had written a wonderful book,| And the ROYAL SOCIETY thought it was true!| So they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too!| | There's a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain,| That could harness a team with a logical chain;| When he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire,| We called him "The Justice," but now he's "The Squire."| | And there's a nice youngster of excellent pith,--| Fate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;| But he shouted a song for the brave and the free,| Just read on his medal, "My country," "of thee!"| | You hear that boy laughing?-- You think he's all fun;| But the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done;| The children laugh loud as they troop to his call,| And the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all!| | Yes, we're boys, --always playing with tongue or with pen,--| And I sometimes have asked,-- Shall we ever be men?| Shall we always be youthful, and laughing, and gay,| Till the last dear companion drops smiling away?| | Then here's to our boyhood, its gold and its gray!| The stars of its winter, the dews of its May!| And when we have done with our life-lasting toys,| Dear Father, take care of thy children, THE BOYS!| 
The True Lover, by A. E. Housman| 19th| The lad came to the door at night,| When lovers crown their vows,| And whistled soft and out of sight| In shadow of the boughs.| | "I shall not vex you with my face| Henceforth, my love, for aye;| So take me in your arms a space| Before the cast is grey.| | "When I from hence away am past| I shall not find a bride,| And you shall be the first and last| I ever lay beside."| | She heard and went and knew not why;| Her heart to his she laid;| Light was the air beneath the sky| But dark under the shade.| | "Oh do you breathe, lad, that your breast| Seems not to rise and fall,| And here upon my bosom prest| There beats no heart at all?"| | "Oh loud, my girl, it once would knock,| You should have felt it then;| But since for you I stopped the clock| It never goes again."| | "Oh lad, what is it, lad, that drips| Wet from your neck on mine?| What is it falling on my lips,| My lad, that tastes of brine?"| | "Oh like enough 'tis blood, my dear,| For when the knife was slit,| The throat across from ear to ear| 'Twill bleed because of it."| | Under the stars the air was light| But dark below the boughs,| The still air of the speechless night,| When lovers crown their vows.| 
The Poet, by Hermann Hesse| 19th| Only on me, the lonely one,| The unending stars of the night shine,| The stone fountain whispers its magic song,| To me alone, to me the lonely one| The colorful shadows of the wandering clouds| Move like dreams over the open countryside.| Neither house nor farmland,| Neither forest nor hunting privilege is given to me,| What is mine belongs to no one,| The plunging brook behind the veil of the woods,| The frightening sea,| The bird whir of children at play,| The weeping and singing, lonely in the evening, of a man secretly in love.| The temples of the gods are mine also, and mine| the aristocratic groves of the past.| And no less, the luminous| Vault of heaven in the future is my home:| Often in full flight of longing my soul storms upward,| To gaze on the future of blessed men,| Love, overcoming the law, love from people to people.| I find them all again, nobly transformed:| Farmer, king, tradesman, busy sailors,| Shepherd and gardener, all of them| Gratefully celebrate the festival of the future world.| Only the poet is missing,| The lonely one who looks on,| The bearer of human longing, the pale image| Of whom the future, the fulfillment of the world| Has no further need. Many garlands| Wilt on his grave,| But no one remembers him.| 
I am the Reaper, by William Ernest Henley| 19th| I am the Reaper.| All things with heedful hook| Silent I gather.| Pale roses touched with the spring,| Tall corn in summer,| Fruits rich with autumn, and frail winter blossoms-| Reaping, still reaping-| All things with heedful hook| Timely I gather.| | I am the Sower.| All the unbodied life| Runs through my seed-sheet.| Atom with atom wed,| Each quickening the other,| Fall through my hands, ever changing, still changeless.| Ceaselessly sowing,| Life, incorruptible life,| Flows from my seed-sheet.| | Maker and breaker,| I am the ebb and the flood,| Here and Hereafter,| Sped through the tangle and coil| Of infinite nature,| Viewless and soundless I fashion all being.| Taker and giver,| I am the womb and the grave,| The Now and the Ever| 
GONE, by Henrik Ibsen| 19th| THE last, late guest| To the gate we followed;| Goodbye -- and the rest| The night-wind swallowed.| | House, garden, street,| Lay tenfold gloomy,| Where accents sweet| Had made music to me.| | It was but a feast| With the dark coming on;| She was but a guest --| And now, she is gone.| 
Gentle Lady, Do Not Sing, by James Joyce| 19th| Gentle lady, do not sing| Sad songs about the end of love;| Lay aside sadness and sing| How love that passes is enough.| | Sing about the long deep sleep| Of lovers that are dead, and how| In the grave all love shall sleep:| Love is aweary now.| 
Contemplation Of The Sword, by Robinson Jeffers| 19th| Reason will not decide at last; the sword will decide.| The sword: an obsolete instrument of bronze or steel,| formerly used to kill men, but here| In the sense of a symbol. The sword: that is: the storms| and counter-storms of general destruction; killing| of men,| Destruction of all goods and materials; massacre, more or| less intentional, of children and women;| Destruction poured down from wings, the air made accomplice,| the innocent air| Perverted into assasin and poisoner.| | The sword: that is: treachery and cowardice, incredible| baseness, incredible courage, loyalties, insanities.| The sword: weeping and despair, mass-enslavement,| mass-tourture, frustration of all hopes| That starred man's forhead. Tyranny for freedom, horror for| happiness, famine for bread, carrion for children.| Reason will not decide at last, the sword will decide.| | Dear God, who are the whole splendor of things and the sacred| stars, but also the cruelty and greed, the treacheries| And vileness, insanities and filth and anguish: now that this| thing comes near us again I am finding it hard| To praise you with a whole heart.| I know what pain is, but pain can shine. I know what death is,| I have sometimes| Longed for it. But cruelty and slavery and degredation,| pestilence, filth, the pitifulness| Of men like hurt little birds and animals . . . if you were| only| Waves beating rock, the wind and the iron-cored earth,| With what a heart I could praise your beauty.| You will not repent, nor cancel life, nor free man from anguish| For many ages to come. You are the one that tortures himself to| discover himself: I am| One that watches you and discovers you, and praises you in little| parables, idyl or tragedy, beautiful| Intolerable God.| The sword: that is:| I have two sons whom I love. They are twins, they were born| in nineteen sixteen, which seemed to us a dark year| Of a great war, and they are now of the age| That war prefers. The first-born is like his mother, he is so| beautiful| That persons I hardly know have stopped me on the street to| speak of the grave beauty of the boy's face.| The second-born has strength for his beauty; when he strips| for swimming the hero shoulders and wrestler loins| Make him seem clothed. The sword: that is: loathsome disfigurements,| blindness, mutilation, locked lips of boys| Too proud to scream.| Reason will not decide at last: the sword will decide.| 
A Calendar of Sonnets: May, by Helen Hunt Jackson| 19th| O Month when they who love must love and wed!| Were one to go to worlds where May is naught,| And seek to tell the memories he had brought| From earth of thee, what were most fitly said?| I know not if the rosy showers shed| From apple-boughs, or if the soft green wrought| In fields, or if the robin's call be fraught| The most with thy delight. Perhaps they read| Thee best who in the ancient time did say| Thou wert the sacred month unto the old:| No blossom blooms upon thy brightest day| So subtly sweet as memories which unfold| In aged hearts which in thy sunshine lie,| To sun themselves once more before they die.| 
The Ballad of the King's Jest, by Rudyard Kipling| 19th| When spring-time flushes the desert grass,| Our kafilas wind through the Khyber Pass.| Lean are the camels but fat the frails,| Light are the purses but heavy the bales,| As the snowbound trade of the North comes down| To the market-square of Peshawur town.| | In a turquoise twilight, crisp and chill,| A kafila camped at the foot of the hill.| Then blue smoke-haze of the cooking rose,| And tent-peg answered to hammer-nose;| And the picketed ponies, shag and wild,| Strained at their ropes as the feed was piled;| And the bubbling camels beside the load| Sprawled for a furlong adown the road;| And the Persian pussy-cats, brought for sale,| Spat at the dogs from the camel-bale;| And the tribesmen bellowed to hasten the food;| And the camp-fires twinkled by Fort Jumrood;| And there fled on the wings of the gathering dusk| A savour of camels and carpets and musk,| A murmur of voices, a reek of smoke,| To tell us the trade of the Khyber woke.| | The lid of the flesh-pot chattered high,| The knives were whetted and -- then came I| To Mahbub Ali the muleteer,| Patching his bridles and counting his gear,| Crammed with the gossip of half a year.| But Mahbub Ali the kindly said,| "Better is speech when the belly is fed."| So we plunged the hand to the mid-wrist deep| In a cinnamon stew of the fat-tailed sheep,| And he who never hath tasted the food,| By Allah! he knoweth not bad from good.| | We cleansed our beards of the mutton-grease,| We lay on the mats and were filled with peace,| And the talk slid north, and the talk slid south,| With the sliding puffs from the hookah-mouth.| Four things greater than all things are, --| Women and Horses and Power and War.| We spake of them all, but the last the most,| For I sought a word of a Russian post,| Of a shifty promise, an unsheathed sword| And a gray-coat guard on the Helmund ford.| Then Mahbub Ali lowered his eyes| In the fashion of one who is weaving lies.| Quoth he: "Of the Russians who can say?| When the night is gathering all is gray.| But we look that the gloom of the night shall die| In the morning flush of a blood-red sky.| Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise| To warn a King of his enemies?| We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,| But no man knoweth the mind of the King.| That unsought counsel is cursed of God| Attesteth the story of Wali Dad.| | "His sire was leaky of tongue and pen,| His dam was a clucking Khuttuck hen;| And the colt bred close to the vice of each,| For he carried the curse of an unstanched speech.| Therewith madness -- so that he sought| The favour of kings at the Kabul court;| And travelled, in hope of honour, far| To the line where the gray-coat squadrons are.| There have I journeyed too -- but I| Saw naught, said naught, and -- did not die!| He harked to rumour, and snatched at a breath| Of 'this one knoweth' and 'that one saith', --| Legends that ran from mouth to mouth| Of a gray-coat coming, and sack of the South.| These have I also heard -- they pass| With each new spring and the winter grass.| | "Hot-foot southward, forgotten of God,| Back to the city ran Wali Dad,| Even to Kabul -- in full durbar| The King held talk with his Chief in War.| Into the press of the crowd he broke,| And what he had heard of the coming spoke.| | "Then Gholam Hyder, the Red Chief, smiled,| As a mother might on a babbling child;| But those who would laugh restrained their breath,| When the face of the King showed dark as death.| Evil it is in full durbar| To cry to a ruler of gathering war!| Slowly he led to a peach-tree small,| That grew by a cleft of the city wall.| And he said to the boy: 'They shall praise thy zeal| So long as the red spurt follows the steel.| And the Russ is upon us even now?| Great is thy prudence -- await them, thou.| Watch from the tree. Thou art young and strong,| Surely thy vigil is not for long.| The Russ is upon us, thy clamour ran?| Surely an hour shall bring their van.| Wait and watch. When the host is near,| Shout aloud that my men may hear.'| | "Friend of my heart, is it meet or wise| To warn a King of his enemies?| A guard was set that he might not flee --| A score of bayonets ringed the tree.| The peach-bloom fell in showers of snow,| When he shook at his death as he looked below.| By the power of God, who alone is great,| Till the seventh day he fought with his fate.| Then madness took him, and men declare| He mowed in the branches as ape and bear,| And last as a sloth, ere his body failed,| And he hung as a bat in the forks, and wailed,| And sleep the cord of his hands untied,| And he fell, and was caught on the points and died.| | "Heart of my heart, is it meet or wise| To warn a King of his enemies?| We know what Heaven or Hell may bring,| But no man knoweth the mind of the King.| Of the gray-coat coming who can say?| When the night is gathering all is gray.| Two things greater than all things are,| The first is Love, and the second War.| And since we know not how War may prove,| Heart of my heart, let us talk of Love!"| 
Wealth, by Joyce Kilmer| 19th| (For Aline)| | From what old ballad, or from what rich frame| Did you descend to glorify the earth?| Was it from Chaucer's singing book you came?| Or did Watteau's small brushes give you birth?| Nothing so exquisite as that slight hand| Could Raphael or Leonardo trace.| Nor could the poets know in Fairyland| The changing wonder of your lyric face.| I would possess a host of lovely things,| But I am poor and such joys may not be.| So God who lifts the poor and humbles kings| Sent loveliness itself to dwell with me.| 
Ode to the Northeast Wind, by Charles Kingsley| 19th| Welcome, wild Northeaster!| Shame it is to see| Odes to every zephyr;| Ne'er a verse to thee.| Welcome, black Northeaster!| O'er the German foam;| O'er the Danish moorlands,| From thy frozen home.| Tired are we of summer,| Tired of gaudy glare,| Showers soft and steaming,| Hot and breathless air.| Tired of listless dreaming,| Through the lazy day--| Jovial wind of winter| Turn us out to play!| Sweep the golden reed-beds;| Crisp the lazy dike;| Hunger into madness| Every plunging pike.| Fill the lake with wild fowl;| Fill the marsh with snipe;| While on dreary moorlands| Lonely curlew pipe.| Through the black fir-forest| Thunder harsh and dry,| Shattering down the snowflakes| Off the curdled sky.| Hark! The brave Northeaster!| Breast-high lies the scent,| On by holt and headland,| Over heath and bent.| Chime, ye dappled darlings,| Through the sleet and snow.| Who can override you?| Let the horses go!| Chime, ye dappled darlings,| Down the roaring blast;| You shall see a fox die| Ere an hour be past.| Go! and rest tomorrow,| Hunting in your dreams,| While our skates are ringing| O'er the frozen streams.| Let the luscious Southwind| Breathe in lovers' sighs,| While the lazy gallants| Bask in ladies' eyes.| What does he but soften| Heart alike and pen?| 'Tis the hard gray weather| Breeds hard English men.| What's the soft Southwester?| 'Tis the ladies' breeze,| Bringing home their trueloves| Out of all the seas.| But the black Northeaster,| Through the snowstorm hurled,| Drives our English hearts of oak| Seaward round the world.| Come, as came our fathers,| Heralded by thee,| Conquering from the eastward,| Lords by land and sea.| Come; and strong, within us| Stir the Vikings' blood;| Bracing brain and sinew;| Blow, thou wind of God!| 
An April Day, by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow| 19th| When the warm sun, that brings| Seed-time and harvest, has returned again,| 'T is sweet to visit the still wood, where springs| The first flower of the plain.| | I love the season well,| When forest glades are teeming with bright forms,| Nor dark and many-folded clouds foretell| The coming-on of storms.| | From the earth's loosened mould| The sapling draws its sustenance, and thrives;| Though stricken to the heart with winter's cold,| The drooping tree revives.| | The softly-warbled song| Comes from the pleasant woods, and colored wings| Glance quick in the bright sun, that moves along| The forest openings.| | When the bright sunset fills| The silver woods with light, the green slope throws| Its shadows in the hollows of the hills,| And wide the upland glows.| | And when the eve is born,| In the blue lake the sky, o'er-reaching far,| Is hollowed out and the moon dips her horn,| And twinkles many a star.| | Inverted in the tide| Stand the gray rocks, and trembling shadows throw,| And the fair trees look over, side by side,| And see themselves below.| | Sweet April! many a thought| Is wedded unto thee, as hearts are wed;| Nor shall they fail, till, to its autumn brought,| Life's golden fruit is shed.| 
The Faithless Wife, by Federico Garcia Lorca| 19th| So I took her to the river| believing she was a maiden,| but she already had a husband.| It was on St. James night| and almost as if I was obliged to.| The lanterns went out| and the crickets lighted up.| In the farthest street corners| I touched her sleeping breasts| and they opened to me suddenly| like spikes of hyacinth.| The starch of her petticoat| sounded in my ears| like a piece of silk| rent by ten knives.| Without silver light on their foliage| the trees had grown larger| and a horizon of dogs| barked very far from the river.| | Past the blackberries,| the reeds and the hawthorne| underneath her cluster of hair| I made a hollow in the earth| I took off my tie,| she too off her dress.| I, my belt with the revolver,| She, her four bodices.| Nor nard nor mother-o'-pearl| have skin so fine,| nor does glass with silver| shine with such brilliance.| Her thighs slipped away from me| like startled fish,| half full of fire,| half full of cold.| That night I ran| on the best of roads| mounted on a nacre mare| without bridle stirrups.| | As a man, I won't repeat| the things she said to me.| The light of understanding| has made me more discreet.| Smeared with sand and kisses| I took her away from the river.| The swords of the lilies| battled with the air.| | I behaved like what I am,| like a proper gypsy.| I gave her a large sewing basket,| of straw-colored satin,| but I did not fall in love| for although she had a husband| she told me she was a maiden| when I took her to the river.| 
In the Street, by Henry Lawson| 19th| Where the needle-woman toils| Through the night with hand and brain,| Till the sickly daylight shudders like a spectre at the pain -| Till her eyes seem to crawl,| And her brain seems to creep -| | And her limbs are all a-tremble for the want of rest and sleep!| It is there the fire-brand blazes in my blood; and it is there| That I see the crimson banner of the Children of Despair!| That I feel the soul and music in a rebel's battle song,| And the greatest love for justice and the hottest hate for wrong!| | When the foremost in his greed| Presses heavy on the last -| In the brutal spirit rising from the grave-yard of the past -| Where the poor are trodden down| And the rich are deaf and blind!| | It is there I feel the greatest love and pity for mankind:| There - where heart to heart is saying, though the tongue and lip be still:| We've been through it all and know it! brother, we've been through the mill!| There the spirits of my brothers rise the higher for defeat,| And the drums of revolution roll for ever in the street!| | Christ is coming once again,| And his day is drawing near;| He is leading on the thousands of the army of the rear!| We shall know the second advent| By the lower skies aflame| | With the signals of his coming, for he comes not as he came -| Not humble, meek, and lowly, as he came in days of old,| But with hatred, retribution for the worshippers of gold!| And the roll of battle music and the steady tramp of feet| Sound for ever in the thunder and the rattle of the street!| 
Science-fiction Cradlesong, by C. S. Lewis| 19th| By and by Man will try| To get out into the sky,| Sailing far beyond the air| From Down and Here to Up and There.| Stars and sky, sky and stars| Make us feel the prison bars.| | Suppose it done. Now we ride| Closed in steel, up there, outside| Through our port-holes see the vast| Heaven-scape go rushing past.| Shall we? All that meets the eye| Is sky and stars, stars and sky.| | Points of light with black between| Hang like a painted scene| Motionless, no nearer there| Than on Earth, everywhere| Equidistant from our ship.| Heaven has given us the slip.| | Hush, be still. Outer space| Is a concept, not a place.| Try no more. Where we are| Never can be sky or star.| From prison, in a prison, we fly;| There's no way into the sky.| 
The Pobble Who Has No Toes, by Edward Lear| 19th| The Pobble who has no toes| Had once as many as we;| When they said "Some day you may lose them all;"| He replied "Fish, fiddle-de-dee!"| And his Aunt Jobiska made him drink| Lavender water tinged with pink,| For she said "The World in general knows| There's nothing so good for a Pobble's toes!"| | The Pobble who has no toes| Swam across the Bristol Channel;| But before he set out he wrapped his nose| In a piece of scarlet flannel.| For his Aunt Jobiska said "No harm| Can come to his toes if his nose is warm;| And it's perfectly known that a Pobble's toes| Are safe, -- provided he minds his nose!"| | The Pobble swam fast and well,| And when boats or ships came near him,| He tinkledy-blinkledy-winkled a bell,| So that all the world could hear him.| And all the Sailors and Admirals cried,| When they saw him nearing the further side -| "He has gone to fish for his Aunt Jobiska's| Runcible Cat with crimson whiskers!"| | But before he touched the shore,| The shore of the Bristol Channel,| A sea-green porpoise carried away| His wrapper of scarlet flannel.| And when he came to observe his feet,| Formerly garnished with toes so neat,| His face at once became forlorn,| On perceiving that all his toes were gone!| | And nobody ever knew,| From that dark day to the present,| Whoso had taken the Pobble's toes,| In a manner so far from pleasant.| Whether the shrimps, or crawfish grey,| Or crafty Mermaids stole them away -| Nobody knew: and nobody knows| How the Pobble was robbed of his twice five toes!| | The Pobble who has no toes| Was placed in a friendly Bark,| And they rowed him back, and carried him up| To his Aunt Jobiska's Park.| And she made him a feast at his earnest wish| Of eggs and buttercups fried with fish, -| And she said "It's a fact the whole world knows,| That Pobbles are happier without their toes!"| 
Patterns, by Amy Lowell| 19th| I walk down the garden paths,| And all the daffodils| Are blowing, and the bright blue squills.| I walk down the patterned garden-paths| In my stiff, brocaded gown.| With my powdered hair and jewelled fan,| I too am a rare| Pattern. As I wander down| The garden paths.| My dress is richly figured,| And the train| Makes a pink and silver stain| On the gravel, and the thrift| Of the borders.| Just a plate of current fashion,| Tripping by in high-heeled, ribboned shoes.| Not a softness anywhere about me,| Only whalebone and brocade.| And I sink on a seat in the shade| Of a lime tree. For my passion| Wars against the stiff brocade.| The daffodils and squills| Flutter in the breeze| As they please.| And I weep;| For the lime-tree is in blossom| And one small flower has dropped upon my bosom.| And the plashing of waterdrops| In the marble fountain| Comes down the garden-paths.| The dripping never stops.| Underneath my stiffened gown| Is the softness of a woman bathing in a marble basin,| A basin in the midst of hedges grown| So thick, she cannot see her lover hiding,| But she guesses he is near,| And the sliding of the water| Seems the stroking of a dear| Hand upon her.| What is Summer in a fine brocaded gown!| I should like to see it lying in a heap upon the ground.| All the pink and silver crumpled up on the ground.| I would be the pink and silver as I ran along the| paths,| And he would stumble after,| Bewildered by my laughter.| I should see the sun flashing from his sword-hilt and the buckles| on his shoes.| I would choose| To lead him in a maze along the patterned paths,| A bright and laughing maze for my heavy-booted lover,| Till he caught me in the shade,| And the buttons of his waistcoat bruised my body as he clasped me,| Aching, melting, unafraid.| With the shadows of the leaves and the sundrops,| And the plopping of the waterdrops,| All about us in the open afternoon --| I am very like to swoon| With the weight of this brocade,| For the sun sifts through the shade.| Underneath the fallen blossom| In my bosom,| Is a letter I have hid.| It was brought to me this morning by a rider from the Duke.| "Madam, we regret to inform you that Lord Hartwell| Died in action Thursday se'nnight."| As I read it in the white, morning sunlight,| The letters squirmed like snakes.| "Any answer, Madam," said my footman.| "No," I told him.| "See that the messenger takes some refreshment.| No, no answer."| And I walked into the garden,| Up and down the patterned paths,| In my stiff, correct brocade.| The blue and yellow flowers stood up proudly in the sun,| Each one.| I stood upright too,| Held rigid to the pattern| By the stiffness of my gown.| Up and down I walked,| Up and down.| In a month he would have been my husband.| In a month, here, underneath this lime,| We would have broke the pattern;| He for me, and I for him,| He as Colonel, I as Lady,| On this shady seat.| He had a whim| That sunlight carried blessing.| And I answered, "It shall be as you have said."| Now he is dead.| In Summer and in Winter I shall walk| Up and down| The patterned garden-paths| In my stiff, brocaded gown.| The squills and daffodils| Will give place to pillared roses, and to asters, and to snow.| I shall go| Up and down,| In my gown.| Gorgeously arrayed,| Boned and stayed.| And the softness of my body will be guarded from embrace| By each button, hook, and lace.| For the man who should loose me is dead,| Fighting with the Duke in Flanders,| In a pattern called a war.| Christ! What are patterns for?| 
Butterfly, by David Herbert Lawrence| 19th| Butterfly, the wind blows sea-ward,| strong beyond the garden-wall!| Butterfly, why do you settle on my| shoe, and sip the dirt on my shoe,| Lifting your veined wings, lifting them?| big white butterfly!| | Already it is October, and the wind| blows strong to the sea| from the hills where snow must have| fallen, the wind is polished with| snow.| Here in the garden, with red| geraniums, it is warm, it is warm| but the wind blows strong to sea-ward,| white butterfly, content on my shoe!| | Will you go, will you go from my warm| house?| Will you climb on your big soft wings,| black-dotted,| as up an invisible rainbow, an arch| till the wind slides you sheer from the| arch-crest| and in a strange level fluttering you go| out to sea-ward, white speck!| 
The Dandelion, by Vachel Lindsay| 19th| O DANDELION, rich and haughty,| King of village flowers!| Each day is coronation time,| You have no humble hours.| I like to see you bring a troop| To beat the blue-grass spears,| To scorn the lawn-mower that would be| Like fate's triumphant shears,| Your yellow heads are cut away,| It seems your reign is o'er.| By noon you raise a sea of stars| More golden than before.| 
From One Augur to Another, by Emma Lazarus| 19th| So, Calchas, on the sacred Palatine,| You thought of Mopsus, and o'er wastes of sea| A flower brought your message. I divine| (Through my deep art) the kindly mockery| That played about your lips and in your eyes,| Plucking the frail leaf, while you dreamed of home.| Thanks for the silent greeting! I shall prize,| Beyond June's rose, the scentless flower of Rome.| All the Campagna spreads before my sight,| The mouldering wall, the Caesars' tombs unwreathed,| Rome and the Tiber, and the yellow light,| Wherein the honey-colored blossom breathed.| But most I thank it--egoists that we be!| For proving then and there you thought of me.| 
A Song Of Eternity In Time, by Sidney Lanier| 19th| Once, at night, in the manor wood| My Love and I long silent stood,| Amazed that any heavens could| Decree to part us, bitterly repining.| My Love, in aimless love and grief,| Reached forth and drew aside a leaf| That just above us played the thief| And stole our starlight that for us was shining.| | A star that had remarked her pain| Shone straightway down that leafy lane,| And wrought his image, mirror-plain,| Within a tear that on her lash hung gleaming.| "Thus Time," I cried, "is but a tear| Some one hath wept 'twixt hope and fear,| Yet in his little lucent sphere| Our star of stars, Eternity, is beaming."| 
A Reminiscence, by Amy Levy| 19th| It is so long gone by, and yet| How clearly now I see it all!| The glimmer of your cigarette,| The little chamber, narrow and tall.| | Perseus; your picture in its frame;| (How near they seem and yet how far!)| The blaze of kindled logs; the flame| Of tulips in a mighty jar.| | Florence and spring-time: surely each| Glad things unto the spirit saith.| Why did you lead me in your speech| To these dark mysteries of death?| 
Baptism, by Claude McKay| 19th| Into the furnace let me go alone;| Stay you without in terror of the heat.| I will go naked in--for thus ''tis sweet--| Into the weird depths of the hottest zone.| I will not quiver in the frailest bone,| You will not note a flicker of defeat;| My heart shall tremble not its fate to meet,| My mouth give utterance to any moan.| The yawning oven spits forth fiery spears;| Red aspish tongues shout wordlessly my name.| Desire destroys, consumes my mortal fears,| Transforming me into a shape of flame.| I will come out, back to your world of tears,| A stronger soul within a finer frame.| 
At Ease, by Walter de la Mare| 19th| Most wounds can Time repair;| But some are mortal -- these:| For a broken heart there is no balm,| No cure for a heart at ease --| | At ease, but cold as stone,| Though the intellect spin on,| And the feat and practiced face may show| Nought of the life that is gone;| | But smiles, as by habit taught;| And sighs, as by custom led;| And the soul within is safe from damnation,| Since it is dead.| 
Apostrophe To Man, by Edna St. Vincent Millay| 19th| (On reflecting that the world| is ready to go to war again)| | Detestable race, continue to expunge yourself, die out.| Breed faster, crowd, encroach, sing hymns, build| bombing airplanes;| Make speeches, unveil statues, issue bonds, parade;| Convert again into explosives the bewildered ammonia| and the distracted cellulose;| Convert again into putrescent matter drawing flies| The hopeful bodies of the young; exhort,| Pray, pull long faces, be earnest,| be all but overcome, be photographed;| Confer, perfect your formulae, commercialize| Bacateria harmful to human tissue,| Put death on the market;| Breed, crowd, encroach,| expand, expunge yourself, die out,| Homo called sapiens.| 
The Morning Walk, by A. A. Milne| 19th| When Anne and I go out a walk,| We hold each other's hand and talk| Of all the things we mean to do| When Anne and I are forty-two.| | And when we've thought about a thing,| Like bowling hoops or bicycling,| Or falling down on Anne's balloon,| We do it in the afternoon.| 
A Ballad of John Silver, by John Masefield| 19th| We were schooner-rigged and rakish,| with a long and lissome hull,| And we flew the pretty colours of the crossbones and the skull;| We'd a big black Jolly Roger flapping grimly at the fore,| And we sailed the Spanish Water in the happy days of yore.| | We'd a long brass gun amidships, like a well-conducted ship,| We had each a brace of pistols and a cutlass at the hip;| It's a point which tells against us, and a fact to be deplored,| But we chased the goodly merchant-men and laid their ships aboard.| | Then the dead men fouled the scuppers and the wounded filled the chains,| And the paint-work all was spatter dashed with other peoples brains,| She was boarded, she was looted, she was scuttled till she sank.| And the pale survivors left us by the medium of the plank.| | O! then it was (while standing by the taffrail on the poop)| We could hear the drowning folk lament the absent chicken coop;| Then, having washed the blood away, we'd little else to do| Than to dance a quiet hornpipe as the old salts taught us to.| | O! the fiddle on the fo'c'sle, and the slapping naked soles,| And the genial "Down the middle, Jake, and curtsey when she rolls!"| With the silver seas around us and the pale moon overhead,| And the look-out not a-looking and his pipe-bowl glowing red.| | Ah! the pig-tailed, quidding pirates and the pretty pranks we played,| All have since been put a stop to by the naughty Board of Trade;| The schooners and the merry crews are laid away to rest,| A little south the sunset in the islands of the Blest.| 
Robert Fulton Tanner, by Edgar Lee Masters| 19th| If a man could bite the giant hand| That catchs and destroys him,| As I was bitten by a rat| While demonstrating my patent trap,| In my hardware store that day.| But a man can never avenge himself| On the monstrous ogre Life.| You enter the room-that's being born;| And then you must live-work out your soul,| Aha! the bait that you crave is in view:| A woman with money you want to marry,| Presitge, place, or power in the world.| But there's work to do and things to conquer-| Oh, yes! the wires that screen the bait.| At last you get in-but you hear a step:| The ogre, Life, comes into the room,| (He was waiting and heard the clang of the spring)| To watch you nibble the wondrous cheese,| And stare with his burning eyes at you,| And scowl and laugh, and mock and curse you,| Running up and down in the trap,| Until your misery bores him.| 
Butterfly Laughter, by Katherine Mansfield| 19th| In the middle of our porridge plates| There was a blue butterfly painted| And each morning we tried who should reach the| butterfly first.| Then the Grandmother said: "Do not eat the poor| butterfly."| That made us laugh.| Always she said it and always it started us laughing.| It seemed such a sweet little joke.| I was certain that one fine morning| The butterfly would fly out of our plates,| Laughing the teeniest laugh in the world,| And perch on the Grandmother's lap.| 
Near Avalon, by William Morris| 19th| A ship with shields before the sun,| Six maidens round the mast,| A red-gold crown on every one,| A green gown on the last.| | The fluttering green banners there| Are wrought with ladies' heads most fair,| And a portraiture of Guenevere| The middle of each sail doth bear.| | A ship with sails before the wind,| And round the helm six knights,| Their heaumes are on, whereby, half blind,| They pass by many sights.| | The tatter'd scarlet banners there| Right soon will leave the spear-heads bare.| Those six knights sorrowfully bear| In all their heaumes some yellow hair.| 
Quebec, by John McCrae| 19th| Of old, like Helen, guerdon of the strong --| Like Helen fair, like Helen light of word, --| "The spoils unto the conquerors belong.| Who winneth me must win me by the sword."| | Grown old, like Helen, once the jealous prize| That strong men battled for in savage hate,| Can she look forth with unregretful eyes,| Where sleep Montcalm and Wolfe beside her gate?| 
An Address to Shakespeare, by William Topaz McGonagall| 19th| Immortal! William Shakespeare, there's none can you excel,| You have drawn out your characters remarkably well,| Which is delightful for to see enacted upon the stage| For instance, the love-sick Romeo, or Othello, in a rage;| His writings are a treasure, which the world cannot repay,| He was the greatest poet of the past or of the present day| Also the greatest dramatist, and is worthy of the name,| I'm afraid the world shall never look upon his like again.| His tragedy of Hamlet is moral and sublime,| And for purity of langucge, nothing can be more fine| For instance, to hear the fair Ophelia making her moan,| At her father's grave, sad and alone. .| In his beautiful play, "As You Like If," one passage is very fine,| Just for instance in fhe forest of Arden, the language is sublime,| Where Orlando speaks of his Rosilind, most lovely and divine,| And no other poet I am sure has written anything more fine;| His language is spoken in the Church and by the Advocate at the bar,| Here and there and everywhere throughout the world afar;| His writings abound with gospel truths, moral and sublime,| And I'm sure in my opinion they are surpassing fine;| In his beautiful tragedy of Othello, one passage is very fine,| Just for instance where Cassio looses his lieutenancy| .  By drinking too much wine;| And in grief he exclaims, "Oh! that men should put an| Enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains."| In his great tragedy of Richard the III, one passage is very fine| Where the Duchess of York invokes the aid of the Divine| For to protect her innocent babes from the murderer's uplifted hand,| And smite him powerless, and save her babes, I'm sure 'tie really grand.| Immortal! Bard of Avon, your writings are divine,| And will live in the memories of you admirers until the end of time;| Your plays are read in family ciFcles with wonder and delight,| While seated around the fireside on a cold winter's night.| 
Modern Love XLV: It Is the Season, by George Meredith| 19th| It is the season of the sweet wild rose,| My Lady's emblem in the heart of me!| So golden-crownèd shines she gloriously,| And with that softest dream of blood she glows:| Mild as an evening heaven round Hesper bright!| I pluck the flower, and smell it, and revive| The time when in her eyes I stood alive.| I seem to look upon it out of Night.| Here's Madam, stepping hastily. Her whims| Bid her demand the flower, which I let drop.| As I proceed, I feel her sharply stop,| And crush it under heel with trembling limbs.| She joins me in a cat-like way, and talks| Of company, and even condescends| To utter laughing scandal of old friends.| These are the summer days, and these our walks.| 
At Nightfall, by Lucy Maud Montgomery| 19th| The dark is coming o'er the world, my playmate,| And the fields where poplars stand are very still,| All our groves of green delight have been invaded,| There are voices quite unknown upon the hill;| | The wind has grown too weary for a comrade,| It is keening in the rushes spent and low,| Let us join our hands and hasten very softly| To the little, olden, friendly path we know.| | The stars are laughing at us, O, my playmate,| Very, very far away in lonely skies,| The trees that were our friends are strangers to us,| And the fern is full of whispers and of sighs.| | The sounds we hear are not what we may share in,| We may not linger where the white moths roam,| We must hasten yet more swiftly, little playmate,| To the house among the pines that is our home.| | The dark is creeping closer yet, my playmate,| And the woods seem crowding nearer as we go,| Oh, how very, very bold have grown the shadows,| They may touch us as they flutter to and fro!| | The silence is too dreadful for our laughter,| The night is very full of strange alarms,| But it cannot hurt us now, O, little playmate,| One more step and we are safe in mother's arms!| 
Cradle Song, by Sarojini Naidu| 19th| FROM groves of spice,| O'er fields of rice,| Athwart the lotus-stream,| I bring for you,| Aglint with dew| A little lovely dream.| | Sweet, shut your eyes,| The wild fire-fiies| Dance through the fairy neem;| From the poppy-bole| For you I stole| A little lovely dream.| | Dear eyes, good-night,| In golden light| The stars around you gleam;| On you I press| With soft caress| A little lovely dream.| 
Exposure, by Wilfred Owen| 19th| I| | Our brains ache, in the merciless iced east winds that knife us . . .| Wearied we keep awake because the night is silent . . .| Low drooping flares confuse our memory of the salient . . .| Worried by silence, sentries whisper, curious, nervous,| But nothing happens.| | Watching, we hear the mad gusts tugging on the wire.| Like twitching agonies of men among its brambles.| Northward incessantly, the flickering gunnery rumbles,| Far off, like a dull rumour of some other war.| What are we doing here?| | The poignant misery of dawn begins to grow . . .| We only know war lasts, rain soaks, and clouds sag stormy.| Dawn massing in the east her melancholy army| Attacks once more in ranks on shivering ranks of gray,| But nothing happens.| | Sudden successive flights of bullets streak the silence.| Less deadly than the air that shudders black with snow,| With sidelong flowing flakes that flock, pause and renew,| We watch them wandering up and down the wind's nonchalance,| But nothing happens.| | | II| | Pale flakes with lingering stealth come feeling for our faces --| We cringe in holes, back on forgotten dreams, and stare, snow-dazed,| Deep into grassier ditches. So we drowse, sun-dozed,| Littered with blossoms trickling where the blackbird fusses.| Is it that we are dying?| | Slowly our ghosts drag home: glimpsing the sunk fires glozed| With crusted dark-red jewels; crickets jingle there;| For hours the innocent mice rejoice: the house is theirs;| Shutters and doors all closed: on us the doors are closed --| We turn back to our dying.| | Since we believe not otherwise can kind fires burn;| Now ever suns smile true on child, or field, or fruit.| For God's invincible spring our love is made afraid;| Therefore, not loath, we lie out here; therefore were born,| For love of God seems dying.| | To-night, His frost will fasten on this mud and us,| Shrivelling many hands and puckering foreheads crisp.| The burying-party, picks and shovels in their shaking grasp,| Pause over half-known faces. All their eyes are ice,| But nothing happens.| 
The City In The Sea, by Edgar Allan Poe| 19th| Lo! Death has reared himself a throne| In a strange city lying alone| Far down within the dim West,| Where the good and the bad and the worst and the best| Have gone to their eternal rest.| There shrines and palaces and towers| (Time-eaten towers that tremble not!)| Resemble nothing that is ours.| Around, by lifting winds forgot,| Resignedly beneath the sky| The melancholy waters lie.| | No rays from the holy heaven come down| On the long night-time of that town;| But light from out the lurid sea| Streams up the turrets silently-| Gleams up the pinnacles far and free-| Up domes-up spires-up kingly halls-| Up fanes-up Babylon-like walls-| Up shadowy long-forgotten bowers| Of sculptured ivy and stone flowers-| Up many and many a marvellous shrine| Whose wreathed friezes intertwine| The viol, the violet, and the vine.| | Resignedly beneath the sky| The melancholy waters lie.| So blend the turrets and shadows there| That all seem pendulous in air,| While from a proud tower in the town| Death looks gigantically down.| | There open fanes and gaping graves| Yawn level with the luminous waves;| But not the riches there that lie| In each idol's diamond eye-| Not the gaily-jewelled dead| Tempt the waters from their bed;| For no ripples curl, alas!| Along that wilderness of glass-| No swellings tell that winds may be| Upon some far-off happier sea-| No heavings hint that winds have been| On seas less hideously serene.| | But lo, a stir is in the air!| The wave-there is a movement there!| As if the towers had thrust aside,| In slightly sinking, the dull tide-| As if their tops had feebly given| A void within the filmy Heaven.| The waves have now a redder glow-| The hours are breathing faint and low-| And when, amid no earthly moans,| Down, down that town shall settle hence,| Hell, rising from a thousand thrones,| Shall do it reverence.| 
A Fairly Sad Tale, by Dorothy Parker| 19th| I think that I shall never know| Why I am thus, and I am so.| Around me, other girls inspire| In men the rush and roar of fire,| The sweet transparency of glass,| The tenderness of April grass,| The durability of granite;| But me- I don't know how to plan it.| The lads I've met in Cupid's deadlock| Were- shall we say?- born out of wedlock.| They broke my heart, they stilled my song,| And said they had to run along,| Explaining, so to sop my tears,| First came their parents or careers.| But ever does experience| Deny me wisdom, calm, and sense!| Though she's a fool who seeks to capture| The twenty-first fine, careless rapture,| I must go on, till ends my rope,| Who from my birth was cursed with hope.| A heart in half is chaste, archaic;| But mine resembles a mosaic-| The thing's become ridiculous!| Why am I so? Why am I thus?| 
The Needle, by Ezra Pound| 19th| Come, or the stellar tide will slip away.| Eastward avoid the hour of its decline,| Now! for the needle trembles in my soul!| Here we have had our vantage, the good hour.| Here we have had our day, your day and mine.| Come now, before this power| That bears us up, shall turn against the pole.| | Mock not the flood of stars, the thing's to be.| O Love, come now, this land turns evil slowly.| The waves bore in, soon they bear away.| | The treasure is ours, make we fast land with it.| Move we and take the tide, with its next favour,| Abide| Under some neutral force| Until this course turneth aside.| 
Camouflage, by Andrew Barton Paterson| 19th| Beside the bare and beaten track of traveling flocks and herds| The woodpecker went tapping on, the postman of the birds,| "I've got a letter here," he said, "that no one's understood,| Addressed as follows: 'To the bird that's like a piece of wood.'| "The soldier bird got very cross -- it wasn't meant for her;| The spurwing plover had a try to stab me with a spur:| The jackass laughed, and said the thing was written for a lark.| I think I'll chuck this postman job and take to stripping bark."| | Then all the birds for miles around came in to lend a hand;| They perched upon a broken limb as thick as they could stand,| And just as old man eaglehawk prepared to have his say| A portion of the broken limb got up and flew away.| | Then, casting grammar to the winds, the postman said, "That's him!| The boobook owl -- he squats himself along a broken limb,| And pokes his beak up like a stick; there's not a bird, I vow,| Can tell you which is boobook owl and which is broken bough.| | "And that's the thing he calls his nest -- that jerry-built affair --| A bunch of sticks across a fork; I'll leave his letter there.| A cuckoo wouldn't use his nest, but what's the odds to him --| A bird that tries to imitate a piece of leaning limb!"| 
What Would I Give, by Christina Rossetti| 19th| What would I give for a heart of flesh to warm me through,| Instead of this heart of stone ice-cold whatever I do!| Hard and cold and small, of all hearts the worst of all.| | What would I give for words, if only words would come!| But now in its misery my spirit has fallen dumb.| O merry friends, go your own way, I have never a word to say.| | What would I give for tears! Not smiles but scalding tears,| To wash the black mark clean, and to thaw the frost of years,| To wash the stain ingrain, and to make me clean again.| 
Rememberance, by Rainer Maria Rilke| 19th| And you wait, keep waiting for that one thing| which would infinitely enrich your life:| the powerful, uniquely uncommon,| the awakening of dormant stones,| depths that would reveal you to yourself.| | In the dusk you notice the book shelves| with their volumes in gold and in brown;| and you think of far lands you journeyed,| of pictures and of shimmering gowns| worn by women you conquered and lost.| | And it comes to you all of a sudden:| That was it! And you arise, for you are| aware of a year in your distant past| with its fears and events and prayers.| 
Karma, by Edwin Arlington Robinson| 19th| Christmas was in the air and all was well| With him, but for a few confusing flaws| In divers of God's images. Because| A friend of his would neither buy nor sell,| Was he to answer for the axe that fell?| He pondered; and the reason for it was,| Partly, a slowly freezing Santa Claus| Upon the corner, with his beard and bell.| | Acknowledging an improvident surprise,| He magnified a fancy that he wished| The friend whom he had wrecked were here again.| Not sure of that, he found a compromise;| And from the fulness of his heart he fished| A dime for Jesus who had died for men.| 
Frolic, by George William Russell| 19th| THE CHILDREN were shouting together| And racing along the sands,| A glimmer of dancing shadows,| A dovelike flutter of hands.| | The stars were shouting in heaven,| The sun was chasing the moon:| The game was the same as the children's,| They danced to the self-same tune.| | The whole of the world was merry,| One joy from the vale to the height,| Where the blue woods of twilight encircled| The lovely lawns of the light.| 
Chicago, by Carl Sandburg| 19th| Hog Butcher for the World,| Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,| Player with Railroads and the Nation's Freight Handler;| Stormy, husky, brawling,| City of the Big Shoulders;| | They tell me you are wicked and I believe them, for I have seen your| painted women under the gas lamps luring the farm boys.| And they tell me you are crooked and I answer: Yes, it is true I have| seen the gunman kill and go free to kill again.| And they tell me you are brutal and my reply is: On the faces of women| and children I have seen the marks of wanton hunger.| And having answered so I turn once more to those who sneer at this my| city, and I give them back the sneer and say to them:| Come and show me another city with lifted head singing so proud to be| alive and coarse and strong and cunning.| Flinging magnetic curses amid the toil of piling job on job, here is a tall| bold slugger set vivid against the little soft cities;| Fierce as a dog with tongue lapping for action, cunning as a savage pitted| against the wilderness,| Bareheaded,| Shoveling,| Wrecking,| Planning,| Bulding, breaking, rebuilding,| Under the smoke, dust all over his mouth, laughing with white teeth,| Under the terrible burden of destiny laughing as a young man laughs,| Laughing even as an ignorant fighter laughs who has never lost a battle,| Bragging and laughing that under his wrist is the pulse, and under his| ribs the heart of the people,| Laughing!| Laughing the stormy, husky, brawling laughter of Youth, half-naked,| sweating, pround to be Hog Butcher, Tool Maker, Stacker of Wheat,| Player with Railroads and Freight Handler to the Nation.| 
The Snow Man, by Wallace Stevens| 19th| One must have a mind of winter| To regard the frost and the boughs| Of the pine-trees crusted with snow;| | And have been cold a long time| To behold the junipers shagged with ice,| The spruces rough in the distant glitter| | Of the January sun; and not to think| Of any misery in the sound of the wind,| In the sound of a few leaves,| | Which is the sound of the land| Full of the same wind| That is blowing in the same bare place| | For the listener, who listens in the snow,| And, nothing himself, beholds| Nothing that is not there and the nothing that is.| 
The Mermaid, by Lord Alfred Tennyson| 19th| I| | Who would be| A mermaid fair,| Singing alone,| Combing her hair| Under the sea,| In a golden curl| With a comb of pearl,| On a throne?| | II| | I would be a mermaid fair;| I would sing to myself the whole of the day;| With a comb of pearl I would comb my hair;| And still as I comb'd I would sing and say,| 'Who is it loves me? who loves not me?'| I would comb my hair till my ringlets would fall| Low adown, low adown,| From under my starry sea-bud crown| Low adown and around,| And I should look like a fountain of gold| Springing alone| With a shrill inner sound| Over the throne| In the midst of the hall;| Till that great sea-snake under the sea| From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps| Would slowly trail himself sevenfold| Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate| With his large calm eyes for the love of me.| And all the mermen under the sea| Would feel their immortality| Die in their hearts for the love of me.| | III| | But at night I would wander away, away,| I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,| And lightly vault from the throne and play| With the mermen in and out of the rocks;| We would run to and fro, and hide and seek,| On the broad sea-wolds in the crimson shells,| Whose silvery spikes are nighest the sea.| But if any came near I would call and shriek,| And adown the steep like a wave I would leap| From the diamond-ledges that jut from the dells;| For I would not be kiss'd by all who would list| Of the bold merry mermen under the sea.| They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,| In the purple twilights under the sea;| But the king of them all would carry me,| Woo me, and win me, and marry me,| In the branching jaspers under the sea.| Then all the dry-pied things that be| In the hueless mosses under the sea| Would curl round my silver feet silently,| All looking up for the love of me.| And if I should carol aloud, from aloft| All things that are forked, and horned, and soft| Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,| All looking down for the love of me.| 
Tears, by Walt Whitman| 19th| TEARS! tears! tears!| In the night, in solitude, tears;| On the white shore dripping, dripping, suck'd in by the sand;| Tears-not a star shining-all dark and desolate;| Moist tears from the eyes of a muffled head:| -O who is that ghost?-that form in the dark, with tears?| What shapeless lump is that, bent, crouch'd there on the sand?| Streaming tears-sobbing tears-throes, choked with wild cries;| O storm, embodied, rising, careering, with swift steps along the beach;| O wild and dismal night storm, with wind! O belching and desperate!| O shade, so sedate and decorous by day, with calm countenance and regulated pace;| But away, at night, as you fly, none looking-O then the unloosen'd ocean,| Of tears! tears! tears!| 
The Great Figure, by William Carlos Williams| 19th| Among the rain| and lights| I saw the figure 5| in gold| on a red| firetruck| moving| tense| unheeded| to gong clangs| siren howls| and wheels rumbling| through the dark city.| 
A Prayer For My Daughter, by William Butler Yeats| 19th| Once more the storm is howling, and half hid| Under this cradle-hood and coverlid| My child sleeps on. There is no obstacle| But Gregory's wood and one bare hill| Whereby the haystack- and roof-levelling wind.| Bred on the Atlantic, can be stayed;| And for an hour I have walked and prayed| Because of the great gloom that is in my mind.| | I have walked and prayed for this young child an hour| And heard the sea-wind scream upon the tower,| And-under the arches of the bridge, and scream| In the elms above the flooded stream;| Imagining in excited reverie| That the future years had come,| Dancing to a frenzied drum,| Out of the murderous innocence of the sea.| | May she be granted beauty and yet not| Beauty to make a stranger's eye distraught,| Or hers before a looking-glass, for such,| Being made beautiful overmuch,| Consider beauty a sufficient end,| Lose natural kindness and maybe| The heart-revealing intimacy| That chooses right, and never find a friend.| | Helen being chosen found life flat and dull| And later had much trouble from a fool,| While that great Queen, that rose out of the spray,| Being fatherless could have her way| Yet chose a bandy-leggèd smith for man.| It's certain that fine women eat| A crazy salad with their meat| Whereby the Horn of plenty is undone.| | In courtesy I'd have her chiefly learned;| Hearts are not had as a gift but hearts are earned| By those that are not entirely beautiful;| Yet many, that have played the fool| For beauty's very self, has charm made wisc.| And many a poor man that has roved,| Loved and thought himself beloved,| From a glad kindness cannot take his eyes.| | May she become a flourishing hidden tree| That all her thoughts may like the linnet be,| And have no business but dispensing round| Their magnanimities of sound,| Nor but in merriment begin a chase,| Nor but in merriment a quarrel.| O may she live like some green laurel| Rooted in one dear perpetual place.| | My mind, because the minds that I have loved,| The sort of beauty that I have approved,| Prosper but little, has dried up of late,| Yet knows that to be choked with hate| May well be of all evil chances chief.| If there's no hatred in a mind| Assault and battery of the wind| Can never tear the linnet from the leaf.| | An intellectual hatred is the worst,| So let her think opinions are accursed.| Have I not seen the loveliest woman born| Out of the mouth of plenty's horn,| Because of her opinionated mind| Barter that horn and every good| By quiet natures understood| For an old bellows full of angry wind?| | Considering that, all hatred driven hence,| The soul recovers radical innocence| And learns at last that it is self-delighting,| Self-appeasing, self-affrighting,| And that its own sweet will is Heaven's will;| She can, though every face should scowl| And every windy quarter howl| Or every bellows burst, be happy Still.| | And may her bridegroom bring her to a house| Where all's accustomed, ceremonious;| For arrogance and hatred are the wares| Peddled in the thoroughfares.| How but in custom and in ceremony| Are innocence and beauty born?| Ceremony's a name for the rich horn,| And custom for the spreading laurel tree.|
